whatsup
hey jesss
hehe nite :)
and even if you don't want to you have to text me
<3 i'm going to bed i can still text if you want
and ugh my parents are gonna kill me if they find me up this late
and you're going to feel disgusting thoughts
you're going to feel jealousy sometimes
you're a human
well it's not like you can help it more than you can help breathing
self-esteem boosters :)
that's why we have friends
we see someone with a outwardly appearing idyllic lifestyle and we want to be like them
we all feel that way
jess jealousy doesn't make you a horrible person
just brutally honest sometimes
and you're not really mean
well if it makes you feel better if you really were a bad person it wouldn't haunt you like this :/
why!?
yeah
what's your fav
where they meet
hmmm naturally i like the happy ending one
i just watched them
how long are they?
there are alternative endings??
oh i finished it
mehh
haha :)
i don't want this to be one of those slowly declining friendships
eh w/e haha
i always start a conversation with you
no it's fine i guess
haha
"k"
yesss but you never start a convo with me
jess we don't talk as much anymore
augh this movie is so sad
and tried to kill himself in the water
he's an amputee
nvm
ugh jess
i won't try to describe it
yeah ignore me keep talking to him
don't even listen to me
you know what
and ugh
"Hey I'm Phil"
and is like
like he walks up to girls
he just
bleh
first let me start by saying jeff dislikes him even more than me
but jeff and i both know him and would both highly advise against it
I mean give him a chance
yeah i realize that
if you want to talk to him you can i guess
gah he like tries to be a player
i can gurantee you he thinks you want him
i strongly dislike him
were you videochatting with him?
????
Barto?
who is this guy??
tell him you gtg?
jessie do you ever think you'll find your soulmate
lol "I want a quicky before school"
dude he wakes up in a sorority
that's a good point
yeah I guess
omg she killed herself
oo you told me about him
was he the one you held hands with?
oooh gotcha
how do you know lawrence?
i don't know
what's wrong?
oh my god he burned his dog!
that's one badass six year old
dude that six year old just beat up a guy
he covered her ears for her
aww they're like boyfriend and girlfriend
*lollipops
like as a kid i would love the drycleaners because they have lollipop
lollipop*
i feel like if you give a kid a lollypop it'll make him happy
you know i really think people are bad at figuring out how to make kids happy
hmm i've thought alot about that
hmm what's it about
ooooh i've wanted to see the butterfly effect forever
one i haven't seen haha
haha seen it
what's a good movie
back
brb
haha
good point
hmm
The Church of Apathetic Agnostics
yes apparently there is
there probably is
that would be cool if there was a church of agnosticism
they don't hate gays
if i were ever to become religious it would be judaism
haha
judaism
again
yeah that would put me off too
uncle?
as in why today
why?
well then nvm haha
haha *there
wow
there
all the people i know that enjoy church is because they meet alot of friends their and stuff
that's what i'm getting at
because it's a community?
sounds deist
and cmon what percent of people our age actually believe in that stuff?
there's judaism?
idk i'm agnostic too but i know religion can do really good things for some people
you've never even thought about it? wow
but idk have you ever thought about picking up a religion?
i know that haha you're agnostic
have you ever considered partaking in a non-extremist organized religious group?
hey i was thinking
hey jess
hey i'm back
haha cya ;)
good point
haha corn is hard to choke on
okay :) i won't i promise
ill tty after
and blehh dinner
and again i'm sorry about your uncle
and honestly it's pretty rare to find people that are completely genuinely happy
it's odd that you find someone who's really happy and really rich though
yeah i suppose
brb
yeah and i think the ones that do have perspective end up really poor so nobody at all listens to them and just labels them crazy
yeah and then in ten years they regret it :(
why did you almost yell at a person in walmart?
okay let me absorb that for a second
whatsup
jesssss hi
byeee
lol
thanks for saying goodnight
byee
i gtg :(
:'(
pleaseeee
i'm curious
!
haha link me though
not you now
what
jess :(
jess :( are you becoming an insomniac
hii
jess
that's a good point
nah it's fine
thaanks haha
that's what i do and it never works haha
but if you were a horny 16 year old heterosexual would it seem creepy
all these people being direct with you makes me wonder if my lack of directness is why i don't get girls
you know
oh :/
you could always tell him you're gay
did he tell you that
haha he's hilarious
"Well I would just unlock the car and get out..."
and he's like
"Break the window with the bat?"
so i said
"If you were in a car, and was locked in but you had a baseball bat what would you do?"
and he replied with
"So if someone put a gun against your head and said you have to have one or the other which would you choose?"
i was like
he's like "Dude you don't have to get me a present"
"Do you like Xbox games or PC games more?"
and i asked him
it's his birthday today
friend
haha this is my
haha it would start a conversation
i want you
hmm then say
say "whatsup"
why haha?
but i liked you then so i was like YESSS
yeah haha!
haha you know the first week after CTY i had this inner debate with you every time i sent you a message for the first time
i always have this debate right before talking to people
hmm
sure
who's the guy
yeah :/
yeah :/ i believe that's correct
aww i'm sorry :(
hey whatsup
jesssssie
okay no more GameMaker tonight haha
this is driving me nuts haha
like it's treating it like it's an NP game or something
asdlfkh
like wtf why can't my computer handle this
mehhhhh
it just spazzes
this thing i'm working on keeps bugging out at like the 8th line
gahh SDFLH
so much better that way
dang
with goldfish?
what type??
yes go do that
yeah it's gonna take a while lol
so i'm trying to make a game that generates that
i have to learn this program for my club
the cellular automata ruleset?
you know that rule 30 thing?
dude guess what i'm doing
yess! it was really good
hey i watched the prestige
okay bye sis/bro/dad/mom
:(
please for more than an hour too
not much of an incentive
you will make me very happy haha
pretty please?
please?

:( :( :( :( :( :(
please get some sleep :(
okayy
my parents will explode if i stay up too late
aughh jess i have to go
they didn't tell me till afterwards
yeah i hate saying it but girls have cheated with me :/
good point
and your stalker :)
yay you like me more than the girl that stole your boyfriend :)
yeah haha i just did -.-
yayy i'm 1 / 28 of your friend base
haha
you have 27 family members
i feel like a speck of dust in a solar system
i feel right now
how incredibly insignificant haha
like you have nooooo idea
haha i'm on your wall right now i feel soooooo insignificant
ahahah sure
haha sure i presume you're asking if you want to make it fb official?
ooo i gotcha
then deleted it haha?
hey did you post on my wall?
dude it like eats everything
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNypW-aSCmE
someone modded minecraft to accept 3D blocks as automata cells
dude this cellular automata stuff is blowing my mind
if we both get into MIT we'll be buddies :)
yeah
i wish it were that easy :/
i feel lonely too haha
haha people always say i should go to their school they never mean it haha
i should
i learned everything myself :/
wow im jealous
really?
:/
oh...
i'll talk to you tomorrow i guess
i gtg to bed
you had a programming teacher?
yeahh haha
did you look at it??
it's an algorithm used for random unber generation
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBfRvDxNVug
it is literally one of the coolest things i've seen
it's an application of chaos theory
it's soooooo damn cool
haha i'm watching a vid on something called rule 30
i'm never picking a topic again
i'm an ass too
nah it's fine
:(
i didn't mean that way it was more like i'm not explaining it well
i'm sorry
specifically the "not someone else part"
yess see that's what i'm getting at
http://www.google.com/imgres?q=mirrors+painting+man+sees+back+of+his+head&um=1&hl=en&safe=off&biw=1680&bih=965&tbm=isch&tbnid=oGBdCRWKZK6NTM:&imgrefurl=http://akh-wonderfullife.blogspot.com/2009/03/out-of-reality.html&docid=ZXGeVvvDsPaxEM&w=388&h=494&ei=2QpfToapOIbe0QG0uJDeAg&zoom=1&iact=hc&vpx=184&vpy=75&dur=4201&hovh=253&hovw=199&tx=128&ty=99&page=1&tbnh=160&tbnw=126&start=0&ndsp=42&ved=1t:429,r:0,s:0
scientifically it's not
like i guess
a myth kind of
augh perception is like
i'm just saying
haha not really
part of the reason i know this bothers me is that i know if i had an identical twin we'd both kill ourselves
augh
but
yes
aughhhh
i could just as easily be him
but what makes it me!?!
yeah i guess that's another thing it boils down to
would I still seem alive?
would i be dead?
nobody would ever notice
but if someone made an identical clone and killed me
yeah i guess i should
i'm not an entity
why do i think of myself as me
it's like
but the idea just freaks me out too
and i realize to you that makes no sense
with no consciousness associated with it
because they show a human person on the other side
who was really afraid of mirrors
and poet i believe
there was some latin writer
well
a poet i think?
damn idk if it was him though...
i think his name is Pablo Neruda?
uhmm
do you know
wait wait wait wait
wait a second
i guess i'm a defective human haha
and apparently i still didn't reach it :/
idk my mind gets caught in a loop
instead of percieving that he is
why i do percieve that I'm alive
if i had an identical twin
like what is self awareness and why do we not want to be destroyed
why do we percieve ourselves concious
honestly the heart of the issue is
too much thinking tonight
blah i might go to bed i don't feel good
ugh nvm :(
jess!
meh i'm sorry
i don't think i'm going to reach you
nah you're pretty adamant on the topic
nah it's fine
forget i said anything
*sigh
you would care alot?
so by the time you exchanged them all
-.- so when do you start caring
exactly
i know you're different don't say that again
you don't care right??
if you exchange one quark for another equivelant quark
okay
you're completely missing the point of this though
you're a different
no no no i know that
i know you'd be different
aha
why would you care though?
but would you be okay with it
i know that
agreed i know this
agreed
would you be okay with that
for another quark that's indistinguishably different
on your body
one quark
what if you could exchange
listen to this
okay jess
hmm...
oh that is cool
continue
and i'm somewhat familiar with that idea
not at all..
why does it matter which one is in which place
and the other's in place B
and one if them is in place A
are indistinguishably different
if two things
let me rephrase that
if two things are the exact same
okay
they are seperate
well that's because no two pieces of paper are the same
if two things are indistinguishly different...
but why does it matter?
why not
separate*
for an identical seperate atom?
one atom of your body
if you could switch out
let me put it this way
which are the same as each other
and atoms and stuff
electrons
you were decompiled to like
but when you were decompiled
that's what the first one did
im afraid you don't get what i'm asking though
okay haha
what?
it's the same as the last scenario
then you get decompiled and essentially destroyed
for a moment
both
do you agree with that
is it still a teleporter?
so essentially
yeah
yeah
what do you mean?
would you do it then?
then... decompile you
then build you on the other side
they scan you
what if
I ask
but then
i'd be okay
yes, since it's no different
would say
around 50% probably
atleast
most people
here's what i'm getting at
haha
and it's the same scenario
good word haha
why does it change from scenario A to scenario B though?
?
why not
you get broken down into plasma
stored so the next person to teleport can use it
i don't know
builds you somewhere else
decompiles you
it scans you
*saying
so i'm say
would that change your opinion?
(Jess)
atomic scan >> atomic build
Jess >> atomic scan
so it goes
but with different parts?
then rebuilt you on the other side
decompiled you
the machine
what if
okay now listen
none
nope
now what about this
okay
there's a 0% chance
pretend for a second
hold on
sigh
you'd do it right?
to go through once
if someone paid you a thousand dollars
no but i mean like
would you use it?
just the way it's supposed to
it worked
if you knew
if you know
but okay
did they do that? i was thinking star trek
you're effectively teleporting right?
and rebuilds you somewhere else
and sends it through a tube
decompiles it sorta
and it takes your body
someone built a machine
let's say
listen to this
okay
hmm
haha but if i decide you'll probably be uninterested and not replyy
usually you decide haha
idk haha
what can we talk about
haha
is it?
idk...
yeah haha it makes me look kinda brutish though
haha shorter than CTY
hey i just got a haircut
it is good
hahaha
they don't judge
but you still rejoin your friends
:)
mmhmm or join the ocean
the glass is half full and you're a pioneer and leading and innovating and doing something before everybody else
or...
were you going to say something?
...
*oh wow
ohw wo
really?
and how do you tell if its fake??
go to a bank and exchange them
make a gajillion of them
like make a cast...
like that seems really easy to profit from
do you think people conterfeit Sacajawea dollars?
thanks lol
spooky
aughh!
0:06
skip
video
youtube
!!!
dude i'm freaking out
this vid has no 6 seconds
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKiarmkO5es&feature=related
DUDE
DUDE
*hanged
jess we never hung out :(
the first comment was like "Did anybody notice there was no '13' seconds?"
every time haha
from 12 seconds to 14 seconds
and it skipped
i saw this vid
haha i love youtube glitches
that makes no sense
there's over 10,000 likes how can there be 303 views
why does it say 303 views?
good!!
that actually blew my mind
woah
oooo asians i love those
hmm i'll watch it right now
ooo what on?
i don't like small talk
it's okayyy
jessie come back
idk that's their attraction to me
they are!!
I was obsessed with zombies
i went through a phase where
that does suck
yeah
i love the idea of apocalypse though
yeah
yeah they scare me too
they're so terrifying
i love zombies
duuude dead people are coming back to life
are actually the stage outfits of the members from this band called lordi
in the movie
haha and all the monsters
and everyone's dead
people start dying
and yeah it's really creppy
they're in a hospital and they go down the elevator and the power goes out and when it goes back on everyone is gone from the hospital except for this guy, his mentally insane daughter, a nurse, a security guard, a hobo, and this other guy with a briefcase
there are people
it's called Dark Floors
i'm watching one right now
haha watch any good movies lately?
weather's good
hmm
so obviously it's not the taste...
but you like hamburger haha?
not really
just once??
i don't like red meat much
no :( we had it for dinner
nopee
hows life
not much jc at the computer
eh that works
you say not much you?
haha
wrong
whatsup
okay let's practice smalltalking
yesss
i think small talk is sorta charictarized by how often you change the topic
i think it's a way to open the conversation
wait
okay let's continue
but if you actually have something to say then yeah ithey care
then they don't care
if you have nothing to say
well i think
yeah
nmyou/
what's your question lol...
what'd you do today
okay
lol do you wanna practice haha?
like small talk?
what do you mean by talk about nothing
if it's findable you are
but it seems too perfect haha
i don't know enough about it to judge
impossible
that seems
really?
i didn't know about that
really?
what do you mean?
what's your answer?
but most people would be like wtf
the time thing
i think if someone else asked me i would say that
yeah haha
it could be cyclical
but i mean
maybe if time is linear
yess that's probably something that has to do with it
jess!
you slept last night right???
aw okay
haha i spent so much time figuring this out
hahaha aww :(
i can explain this if you want haha
a shadow is completeeeely different
jess that's not a shadow of it
that's not a shadow of it...
idk why they did it kinda tilted though
haha
okay
think of this for a second
okay
with each of its vertices extruded along a spacial representation of the fourth dimention
it is a 3 dimensional cube
i actually do get that
yeah i want toooo! you can help me haha!
and who do i remind you of btw?
Z'
Z prime?
Q...?
Z...
Y...
X...
what would you use as a variable for the fourth coordinate?
haha everything would be in four coordinates
yeahh i think it would be reallllly freaking cool
based on the pythagrean theorem
i was really interested in writing an application that shows what it looks like to have a 4d cube passing through 3d existence
you know
yeah
i know what you meant haha
but we can only see a slice of a 3d one
like we can see a WHOLE 2d object
we really only see it in 2d
we can see a 3d object
so while yes
likewise if you're living in a cube all you see is a square
all you see is a dot
if you're living on a line
all you see is a line
if you're living on a sheet of paper
like
you see in dimension n-1
dimension n'
if you're in
soo
but you can't see all of it
you can see "it"
with a 3d cube
okay
oh okay nvm go eat
you see in
n-dimension
the
if you're in
look
okay
hmm
if you could see an object in 3d you could see inside of it
but we can see it in 3d
we can see it
our vision is like a TV screen
we see in 3d
nooo haha we can percieve a persepective based on it
jess we can't even see a 3d cube
yeah
i believe hypercube is the correct terminology
oooh what specifically about a 4d cube?
and why is that a decision for you haha?
i'm good
how are you
haha
Jessica Equality Lin
:)
tty in one minute
byeee
so we can continue this lololol
hey i gtg i'll text you
it will...down the spectrum
but you see them slowly go toward the event horizon
yeah you can't see them
once they get past the event horizon
that's the light past the event horizon
so i think it may work a little differently
* spacial relativity
spellfail lol
speacial relativety kicks in
as you accelerate faster and faster
well that's because
with some speacial relativety thrown in
a reverse doppler effect
so it's the same
as you move closer it climbs back up
so on the black hole
they're really the same anyway
but in this case you're kinda switching up Frequency and Velocity
it's the same with light...
to replicate that 440 HZ
move through the source
you would have to actually
at 0 HZ
and theoretically
to reach that 440 HZ
you'll have to accelarate at faster speeds
1 HZ... 1/2 HZ ... 1/4 HZ ... 1/8 HZ
which it never reaches
and as the pitch gets closer to 0 HZ
it'll stay at 440 HZ
at the right speed
accelerate towards it
but if you slowly
it'll slowly slide down the musical spectrum
440 HZ...439 HZ...438 HZ...
and the sound source slowly sloes
so if you're standing still
essentially moving up the sound spectrum
A880
you hear the next Octave A up
if you move towards it at 340 m/s
0 Hertz
you hear nothing
at 340 m/s
now if you move away from the source
you hear an A right?
relative to the pitch
if you're standing still
there's a pitch at A440 Hertz
ready
but listen
i'll still text
we've got a pitch
so okay
btw at 1:00 i have to move to text btw
ooo runn
plug it in?
440 Hertz
at a constant tone
let's say you have a speaker
okay make an anology with light
yeah
jess you know the doppler effect right?
infrared would dissapear first
and it's not infrared it's ultraviolet
if the light is caught there what causes it to move down the spectrum?
?
or escape away from it
because the rays of light that emit right from the event horizon are caught and can't escape towards the black hole
you would see the person right?
the event horizon
if you passed through
okay think of it this way
but as you get infinitely close to the black hole's horizon it get's more and more noticable
because it's smaller amounts
granted if you're at a track meet it's going to be much more undetectable
yeah but it happens for everything though
and push the specturm
would cause a redshift
moving towards it
slooooowly decreases
so the frequency
the spectrum slows down
in effect the person is getting sucked into the black hole
so since
blue-er
and farther away -
so it looks redder
the lights spectrum is increased
and when an object is moving towards you
redshift
there's a phenomena in physics called
do you know how they figured out that the universe is expanding?
hold on
hush
no wait listen to this for a second
like
it would go back up the spectrum
towards the black hole
moved
yeah but if you like
but it would still fade just take less time
shorter wavelength
i understand that
but infared light?
i was gonna say their image is caught on the horizon
what? infrared light?
is if you got sucked in too
ironically the only time you'd see them again
YES YOU'RE RIGHT PLEASE GO TO BED!?!
0.0
but when was the last time you slept!?!?!
okay haha now what you're saying makes sense
REALLY!?
WTF!?!
that's what you meant
OOOOH
to be precise
or just outside it
you would have to be moving at a direction where your velocity vector is tangent to the event horizon
slightly less than it
or for realistic purposes
if you're traveling at the speed of light
like for instance
that's only with the right initial trajectory
?
everything goes through orbit
like
you said that
hold on
haha
i was gonna say something
no
know
i know right
but you said that
so infinite mass==infinitely large event horizon == we're all dead
is directly proportional to it's mass
the size of a black hole's event horizon
because
they would swallow everything
yeah if they didn't have finite mass
haha i looked at it
but they have finite mass
0 in denominater== infinite density
and 0 volume
cuz density = mass/volume
duh
well that yeah
infinite mass?
it's cool
if black holes had infinite mass they would swallow everything
black holes don't have infinite mass?
waitt
what if your trajectory is straight for it?
isn't that sort of assuming you're caught in equilibrial rotation around the event horizon?
but to everyone else they go right in?
isn't it to the person they take forever to reach the center?
isn't it the other way around?
to everybody else
i know about this
OMG WAIT
what was it?
i actually don't know much about string theory
dude i have no clue on that
do you think one black hole leads to another?
cuz spacially it's only three
i wanna read up on it
idk what the other dimensions are thoughh
the more my brain crashes
but the more i think about it
i can understand that
but yeah i agree with that
i can tell
there's a youtube video on this
but not always
and sometimes we run in parallel with others
and we sort of all move along that path
and you made a bunch of different paths that go somewhere
if you made a giant race track
it's like
that's sort of time
a dimension
move through?
and we sort of
which we actually do
we live in an 11-dimensional world
it's kind of like
me tooo haha
in physics class
*day
like ad ay
one class
and so i suck at it
well i'm not going to lie i did sleep through the class on speacial relativety
what did they disagree on?
what was it on?
was i there??
was this the universe is a donut thing?
this year??
oooo let's talk about physics
what's something you're really passionate about
why do you think that is?
mehh i miss our long drawn out conversations
A.I.Artificial Intelligence
you should watch that movie
and he wakes up and humans are like perfect
where the robot human sleeps for a billion years
it's like that one movie
idk
not from my perspective
100000000000000000 years from now we're all gonna be like you i think
but you seem so like flawless
idk i know it seems weird
jess did it ever occur to you that maybe you're the next step in the evolutionary ladder?
well i guess we're sexually different
i don't?
and yeah probably
i'm not a friend?
and yess penises gross me out too likewise pedophiles do too
and looks are kinda what drive that :/
well really humans still function the same way animals do
bleh
jesss don't be ridiculouss
whyy?
taaaalk to me
why aren't you ready?
i did haha
11 11
aren't you watching up?
you're not mean
no?
tell me what you think
oooh okay :)
yeahhh i love it :)
up?
robbing a bank lol?
?
like taking over the world
really? explain this to me
what about jessica
maybe a super mercenary?
you know, i'd rather have the mentality of a superhero but the powers and appearance of a super villain
hmm?
hey you should talk to me more i think i can bring out your inner asian
looks really cool actually
it's C basically
they're using a language called arduino
!!
and mehhh! by brother is learning to program microchips in college im so jealous
hahaha you are soo asian!
yess you look very asian
did he know you're sixteen?
yeah that is scary
wow
that is mildly strange
and what???
too hot to handle jess, too hot to andle
jesssy
okay :) goodnight
haha
yesss you are
but my parents explode if i stay up past 1:00
i can still text youu
on that note ima go to bed
hmm polymorphic code just blows my mind
you know i don't think there's a huge line between technology and biology
weren't mitochondria originally organisms?
idk it's just weird
yeah i know but like
neither are cells
like isn't it technically not alive?
hmm would you consider a virus a living thing?
what constitutes feeling?
well wait a second
like does a robot feel good when he obeys orders?
it's kinda weird to think about it
incentive haha?
idk it's kinda like
*alive
alternatively without hapiness none of us would be a live
but yeah but i think
obviously i haven't taken chemistry...
yeah dopeamine or something
yeah that is a good point... i mean sex and marjuana release the same chemical
yeah that is a good point
more people = more possible mates
and the more confident people can use humor to sort of interact with more people
like humor is sort of how we meet new people
my initial conclusion was it's sort of like a social lubricant
why do you think humor exists? like what evolutionary advantage is there?
but it actually made a lot of sense
and i realize he said it comically
and I smashed the ice cream cone into his face and I said YOU REMEMBER ME FOREVER!!!! And then I ran away"
and I walked up next to him and got down on one knee
who was eating an ice cream cone
I went up to a little boy
so the other day
"We all like to be remembered
Dane Cook was like
so
yeah i know!
Dane Cook
i remember
ahaha really?
and they feel important and like they'll be remembered
and i guess you're right...all these social networking sites just give an easier vessel for people to put themselves out there
or go on killing sprees
it's why some people become mass murderers
or be noticed and remembered
and i think subconciously people want to sort of leave a legacy
and she was like why would somebody ever do that
but i remember once i was working on a science fair project and my teacher said that a lot of the projects had been vandalized
like i mean some things are really obvious like things that promote our survival
people always like question why people do some things
you know i've actually thought about this alot
!
okay go
so you start it
okay haha i'd start but i don't wanna start with something depressing
jess i wanna have a deep philosophical conversation with you
haha
why are you sorry
?
mehh i'm tired
lala
jesssssy
i don't feel warm and fuzzy
like when i'm actually under a warm fuzzy blanket
it's kinda like a memory of something that didn't happen
idk it's weird i have this warm and fuzzy feeling associated with blankets but i never seem to get the feeling
aww haha
and why do you feel warm and fuzzy
haha nomuundari just called me warm and fuzzzzy that's so weird
aww haha
heyyy bud
okay byeee :)
do you know the movie Secret?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut6twAXLivo
and you never play more than two notes at the same time
hahah there's only two parts where you play more than one note at a time
i have the music to both
yeah haha
yeah there's like two changes though
i wanna learn it one handed
yeah haha
but yes it is hard to sound nice
like we split it up into two parts
haha my friend and i are doing it like as a duel for this fair
yeah of course i love it
yeah i have no clue
oh my bud played that for our last recital
do you know solfegietto btw?
yeah gp
yeah like Solfegietto haha
haha the problem with classical music is it's hard to remember the name of pieces
from your perspective
btw jw whats the hardest piece you know on piano?
i guess the idea is depressing
hmm do you believe that?
i just try to convince myself it's an inanimate object
really?
haha we're both losers already so go ahead
then why?
cuz you're in six AP's?
why?
blah
six AP's right?
that's probably a good idea
obviously you've been scarred lol
hmm im sorry
do you think you two will go out again?
why am i a rapist :( and why do your teeth hurt
back i got bored
brb i need to practice piano
oh really lol
and then we got to be really good friends and you stopped talking to me a day ago haha
remember you thought i was a rapist?
haha we met at CTY?
remember me
heyyy
l8r g8r
haha otay
and if you really can't live without me i'll be up for another hour if you want you can text me
haha :) we'll talk tomorrow
haha we weren't talking anyway
ahh jess i have to go
i'm watching inglorious basterds
i love Brad Pitt
first off that's not gay and second that's completely different
everyone calls wrestlers gay
:'(
mehhh i hate it when people have that reaction
:(
i'm not gay btw
yeah it's my main sport
i watched it once with my wrestling team but it sucked cuz i hate them and i fell asleep in the middle
Inglorious Basterds I'm watching it rightnow
hey how are you
you back yet haha?
okayy
what were they arguing over?
blaldfkh
aww jess :(
and ahhh i keep trying to fix Microsoft Visual Basic Express
how is that good
none of my applications are working and my system's restoring right now
jessss :(
blahh System Restore please save me
mehhhhhhh my computer is not working
aghhhhh
ever
never ever ever mess around with Regedit
ohhh my comp is being stupid
mehhhh :(
ahhhh computer
"tsktsk for being a stupid human"
hahah i actually thought that at first
there's not even a 'y' lol
how the hell is that a word
dude i played the computer in hangman and its word was TSKTSK
maybe 25
i don't think we will past 20
of course not haha
haha yeah stupid y
i think cuz neither have any vowels besides "y"
seems really hard to me
that and "why"
ikr?
i cheated though i looked up a bunch of hard words and it seemed the hardest to me
rhythm
hahahahaha
third letter
Y
:)
NOPE
haha nope to a
six letters again'
okay
hmm
wait
nah
actually
i wanna see something
wait can i go again
that's unbelievably awesome
and really?!?!
haha i decided what it would be before you went
yeah ahha
you got it haha
lolol
first letter lo
wow
gogogogo
_like this_
i can't use underscores because two adjacent ones make an underline thing
. e . . y .
second to last letter
haha i'm not allowed to answer that
or rhetorical thinking out loud?
is that a question or a statement?
nope
nope
nope
second letter
nope
six letters
one sec
not that many
wtf
_ _ _ _ _ _
okay you go
ahahah WOW that took forever
"t"?
"m"?
"h" ?
mehhhh
s?
d?
dang
"b"
hmmm
middle letter i guess?
okay haha i?
:( i'm dead
:( o?
e?????
?
a
z and x are both not?
then they've either highly underestimated you or you have highly underestimated them
but after that go with the traditional approach
time
the first
90 percent of the time you cant go wrong with z or x
*people
when you play with smart peole
haha actually believe it or not
is that a word
ozz
axe?
or "sad"
"and"
or
"bug"
and logically you wouldn't pick
yeah haha because i know you're smart
x
z
YES
i actually hate it when people say that
entertain me haha
jessss im bored
nah you'd be a good ninja
but like a good ninja
i could see you as a ninja maybe
wait really??
awww! haha
good lol
i could sorta see that i guess
wow
howd that happen
really lol?
what are you up to today
talk to jess
watch a movie
uhmm doing some stuff for school
did some work for my dad...
i hope your friend feels better too
i'm sorry :(
oh that is stupid :/
do they actually think you're gay?
meh that sucks :/
what happened now?
jess do i annoy you lol?
ahh it's gross
my backyard is a swamp
eh
how are you
hey jess
im glad your confident :)
aww
jesss what if my house breaks

:( i didn't want you to know like this but i can't hide it
i'm a rabbit
i'm not actually a boy
yeah :( if i die i want you to know...
jesssssss
what if my house breaks
it is unbelievably windy here
jesss im freaked out kinda
my power keeps going out
hold on
oooh let's finish it
hopefully
tornado
cuz everyone's posting on the newsfeed that they're super scared cuz of a tornadoe
well i'm kind of worried
and hmm at the moment
sorry power died again
hahahaha what's it called
what movie?
whatcha doingggg
BAM!
bam?
BAM
just
yeah
my power just cut out
YAY
hi dere :)
backk
don't explode while i'm gone please
ill bb in 20
:)
LOL
hehe i like dat
jessbear
haha yess
i thought that was kind of a cool idea
i think it translates to like Soul Friendship
and it mentioned something the Irish call Anam Cara
btw i was reading my required reading book
hahaha nobody ever says your hair's funny but you!
haha that's a good point
between a teddy bear and a cute boy?
idk what's the diff
jess i think it's weird how you can snuggle with a teddy bear but not a human
aw
haha you have teddy though
dude you need a puppy
ahahah awwww
haha
aww
haha snuggling with yourself?
with?
hows it going
hiiiii
hi
brbbb dessert
haha i aren't either i just try to not be an idiot about it to fit in
hmm that's okay
whos your favorite actor
haha the playthrough
waiting for my parents to go to bed
talking to my friend jess
haha hey jessbear
jess!
jess?
jesss!
jessyjessy jessy
i miss you <3 feel better bud
hey i have to go :(
cuz if it's really bad i might have crap that needs to be done
it'll be easier to plan after irene hits
next week?
chinese sorry
*from
and she's translating something into chinese that is emotionally taxing
-.- her uncle died
them?
trying to cheer up a friend but i don't know what to say :(
:(
:?
that is depressing
oh i'm sorry :(
what is it?
do you need to go?
oh i'm sorry
mandarin?
jesss
pretty bad
haha it's called cyborg soldier
hehe
Guy: yes
Cop: 'morning
haha this movie
like blaaah it's good to know there's atleast another someone out there something like me
jesssie
i am so glad i met you
now she's all like "c'mon you know you're attractive"
it's infuriating to me
still
she called me ugly?
and now she doesn't get why i'm angry
wow i called this male popstar ugly and my friend(girl) said quote "I'm enjoying the irony"
LOL
he hasn't watched you in forever
hehe
spongebob's watching you
but nah you're okay
sorry
love that scene
"Aw"
"Yeah it's weird"
"Really?"
"Oh well that's normal. See I get freaked out at ridiculous things like...clowns...and the little rags they use to wipe down tables and stuff."
he's like
"Oh my god i'm so freaked out. I just got bit!"
and she's like
this girl is freaked out cuz she just got bit by a hobo
aw your like the guy in zombieland
you get bothered by a lot haha
why??
jesssss you there
and you're not really that mean
and it's okay you're much less mean than people in general
you are a little mean but yeah people who just kinda smash themselves can get aggrevating
why u divorcin him?????
promenade?
i live almost an hour from my school so i don't think theyll mind
wanna go there?
hmm my mom said 40
oh
it's like 40 min from me
really?
obviously lehigh valley
hmm where is it
hmm i usually go to KOP but whatever one
lol we could go to the mall or something
didnt you not wanna do movies?
2218 hill road perkiomenville PA
18074 is zip
hmm
one sec
i should really learn my new adress
hmmm did you watch any movies
you talked to me :)
yeah :(
then runs of with it then drops it in the woods
she doesnt even bring it to me she steals it
god the one dog keeps stealing the ball from Desi
aww haha
back
brb take a walk with my mom
doot doot doot do doo
it's pretty haha
although we have clouds that look it
haha it's not here that's weird
lol thunder enjoys you hehe
as touching as that is it probably would not end well
thanks :D
what haha?
but i love being your friend either way :)
which is kind of tragic in an odd way
jess <3 you're like the perfect girl i think if i was asexual we'd be great together
aw
boopdee doop lol
and nah ur not
i have faith in you to do the right thing]
just work it out
sigh
lol haha
?
now you like him
wow
whoo>?
really!?!?!
gah i need a bandaid i got a blister on my thumb from playing drum pads on my friends keyboard lol
okayy
does it have to be a viola piece?
it's played on a viola but okay
LOL okay
Handlebars haha
haha :) hows jess
backk
brb shower
i misss you
srry lol
i was gonna but then was slike no fuckin way that's gonna happen
haha i only did a one handed one
wow that went surprisingly well
ima see how it goes
brb ima try to do a cartwheel with no hands
*a knot in your hair
god im unbelievably stupid
a hair in your knot
did i really say that
wow
does it like undo itself
lol if you tie a hair in your not
i like your hair
whattt??
idk
but long hair is like beautiful
short hair is cute
idk
well
idk i think long hair is cute but do what you think looks cute
i love long hair
NOOO
okay yeah that's up there too
craziest is def green
haha yeah ik
lol like purple?
lala
but like funny - er
amir is kind of like a nice version of Yoni
i love that show haha
do you watch Jake and Amir
so we came in for a break haha
she started eating grass so i figured she's dehydrated
bacjkkk
she seems bored
brb now i really wanna play ball with my dog haha
really? hahah i love it
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAPZ-hGqSWE&feature=fvwp&NR=1
or think of Dug from Up
jesss
firetails trumps all though
maybe a psyduck
actually ditto's are really ugly
which isn't really cute
or a ditto
like a giant jigglypuff
like in real life
imagine a really cute pokemon
don't be depressed
aw jess i'm sorry!!!
that also bothers me
yeah :/
i know that's horrible
try to not think about it?
but i just sorta
i mean it is depressing
yeah i know :(
probably
within the next week
i mean someone's going to die from getting hit in the head by a coconut
not really i think
yeah :(
btw that majorly sucks
hehehe if i lived in nj i'd be evacuating right now probs
she's a cutie
haha you can come over and meet mine
!!
get a corgi
she is!! she's nice
evil kitteh hehe
yeah the cat messed with her heaad though
Desi is so nice she would always try to play with the cat
yesss it is
and when it was just Desi she would always try to play ball with the kitty :(
and they tried to get the other one
mehhhh
and they sorta killed her
and she brought our dogs father over
who has a bunch of dogs
share dogs with this other lady
see we like
sorta
well
then it's just depressing lol
it doesn't seem so bad until it's your cat
yeah :/
yesss she is
yeah like groundhogs :(
and my parents are okay with it
i don't like the other dogs they kill animals :(
cuz they are all rat terriers she's a corgi :(
though
she is cute! the other dogs ostracize her
and our other family dog fell asleep next to me and desi like crawled over her and sat on me
like i was trying to take a nap earlier
lol although my dog gets jealous its so cutee
and my dog's small i cuddle with her
hehehe ik
haha so your parents never find it LOL
and keep it up in your room
get a really small one
that's my prescription
i think you need a dog
well there is irony in that i guess
aw :( i'm sorry
rut ro
how so?
haha if you're honestly interested then i guess you would be a good real gf
haha it's okayy
Jess i love how you pretend to be interested <3 you would be a perfect fake girlfriend haha
for Left for Dead a lot
ahahahah yeah i did that too
and we did a walkthrough on this software package used for 3D game developement and we did like a intro to Game Scripting with JavaScript
god so nerdy
he did one with this mod he got for Minecraft
oh uhm we did one for Minecraft we're going to do one for a horror game called Amnesia
and gaming buds and stuff
like we're programming buds and stuff
were pretty much a geek team
for fun haha?
like my best friend and i do walkthrough's and gameplay vids and stuff and play at each other's houses
now i really only play videogames like socially
yeah so for every time he dies he gets three kills
yeahhh haha
his is 3.0
and my K/D is like 1.16
to put it in perspective i'm better than every other person i know at Halo
if he was telling the truth he's a Halo GOD
you know Tae-Woo?
facebook helps too lol
90
and the programming bumped it up to like 9-
the only good thing is like before i played them i couldn't type and afterwards i could type like 80 wpm
i sorta rotted my childhood brain on them,
Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game's
idk i don't like MMORPG's
it looks like Age of Mythology vs WOW
AND WHAT?!??!
and is it MMORPG like WOW?
you played for four hours?!
haha Nomuun's brother is like nationally ranked in that i think
hahaha i don't think you'd like Halo very much though
!!!!
!
it'd be so much fun
awww you should play one with me!!
how are you jess?
okay i'll stop
such a nerd
i made my own texture pack for it haha
haha <3 that game
which isn't quite as typical
haha although Minecraft is third
i'm such a typical guy
COD is probably second
haha i love Halo
why do you ask?
but i'm fine with doing more conventional things like going to the mall and seeing movies and events and eating dinner with their family and that stuff
instant spark hahaha
like any girl that likes to play videogames or go to scary movies
or watching scary movies that's fun too
idk what i see in the appeal but that's just awesome
hahaha honestly my favorite thing in the world to do with like a girlfriend or just a girl in general is play videogames
uhm hang out at the mall
go to movies
kind of a hard question
well
me specifically or in general
which one?
lol
but okay
def not how you spell it
lol double entendre
jessssss
jessie
jessie
aww jess i'm sorry for depressing you <3
or spelled midevil
it should be pronounced med-eey-EV-uhl
medieval is such an odd word
cuz just a gf will never like slap you
although there are downsides to having a friend/gf in one
that doesn't really answer your question i realize that
just my opinion
and watch Zombieland lololol
whereas if you're friendly with her too you guys can hang out at each others house
cuz you're always doing something romantic like cuddling or making out or flirting
but i think it's probably overall better off that way
like it can be a really good one but it breaks really easily
a flimsy relationship
i think when you go right from stranger to lovers it's kinda
leads to a totally different relationship than if you become friends first then become something more
going out with a girl before you become her friend
from past experiences
like what i've noticed is
i think it highly depends
like relationship?
hmm do you mean like when you're with a girl?
hahaha see the problem is that while all girls say they want that NONE of them do
like legit
i am a chick flick boyfriend dude
it was pretty sad
lol
such a tragic story
haha i wrote a piano song for a girlfriend once but then we broke up and i never played it for her

megahuge uberrich

yeah our friend's parents
it's insane
omg omg omg omg omg
it's the only bedroom on the attic level
my bedroom has a huge sceanic view of the beach from the third story
around the TV
and a curlaround couch that could easily fit twenty people
getting a pool table
the basements got pingpong
one in the basement
one in the master bedroom
a megahuge flatscreen TV in the livingroom
probably 15+ bathrooms
nine bedrooms
it's got
i've seen in possibly my whole life
the nicest house
it is
god
my
oh
i went inside it for the first time
but they just rebuilt the house
i've been to the place before
at the shore
i'm staying at
this house
jess jess jess
jess jess guess what
jess jess jess omg omg omg
hey i gotta go but i can still text you
brb
haha yeah spur of the moment thing (i miss you too)
thank's jessmonster :)
even if you think i'm boring and annoying (:
w/e haha i'll still be your bud either way
don't change though haha
food for thought
hmm
but somehow you're completely innocent but not the least bit naive
whatever the noun form of naive is
follows
normally innocence
it's odd
haha
it can be
jess you're the most innocent person i've ever met and probably will ever meet
haha mom i'm so glad you're not dead
aww haha that's so cute
at all
do you feel better?
not you spell it. but w/e
wait nvm
chiuaha
gasdlfh
:(
we should play chess sometime
jesss i miss yoou
lol hail stings
ok im back
idk :) fun brb ima go run out in the hail
you know i spent my whole day playing chess vs. the computer
jess please don't be scared
jess it's more scared of you then you are of it
haha go outside and run around in it
yeah c'mon enjoy that
and i thought you loved rain too!
sorry
i love it
and damn it's pouring here too now
don't do that!
but i mean jess you're sort of putting an oppurtunity out there for a bad self-fulfilling prophecy
eventually we're both going to die
eventually yeah
see that's ridiculous jess
nothing bad is going to happen okay??
then why don't you take a nap
just reiterating
nobody is going to hurt you
please don't be
jess
and all that bad crap
c'mon jess that's ridiculous
or you're outlook on life
weather is unpredicable you can't let that ruin your day
and rain is rain
or caution
because black and yellow symbolize danger
so it's ridiculous tosay that everything bad happens around the colors black and yellow
etc.
school buses...
that's also why construction equipment is the same colors
so they keep your attention
are painted black and yellow
and cars operate on
which are dangerous
roads
and they're everywhere around my house and the first time i saw them they scared the crap out of me
just so predators confuse it with bees
that's black and yellow
there's a type of moth
shh!
and there's a type of moth
listen!
that's why bees are black and yellow
it's usually painted black and yellow
so when something is supposed to catch your eye
those two colors symbolize danger
both in nature and mankind
the black and yellow thing is ridiculous
okay
jess listen to me
jess listen for a second
for a second
hold on
no it's white
okay
hold on
stopp
jess
...
okay
jess
jess!
please!?
for a second
to me
listen
jesss
jess
is that like a jinx or something?
yeah what's with that?
please
you need to calm down though
jess you're having a majorly bad day
did you look both ways?
and you giggle about it
jess that happens every day
but it shouldn't freak you out THIS much
i agree
okay yes that is mildly freaky
every event is independent of every other
but you didn't right?
jess you don't believe in jinxes or any of that stuff
you're not going to get run over
a piano's not going to fall on you
nobody's going to hurt you
okay!!?
that nothing is going to happen to you
i promise you
jess
please calm down okay?
jess jess jess jess

and i think ima go to bed
jess you're silly
its a sad movie
blah
i feel like i belong there
ooo i want to
you don't wanna know what it's about. have you ever been to china?
The Dilemma
i was watchingthis really good movie
haha
i wasn't
you know
meh nvm
you suckk
one nobody uses anymore :)
don't tell me you don't wanna blow up a bridge :)
oh cmon
but it would be fun...
wouldn't it be fun?
we should go and burn a bridge together
well i get that feeling sometimes
like you need to watch a show or somethin
you really really need to rot your brain on something
it is a bit
and guys still want girls that'll put out
but i think girls still want a guy that'll make them feel safe
haha i think the lines of the relationship have sorta melded over time though
depressing in my opinion
love - evolutionary symbiotic survivalist benefactor
yeah
that's my theory lol
survive and raise children
and for females
for males that happens to be reproduce
therefore fulfilling all the needs of both sexes
and the duty of the female - to sex up the male
the duty of the male - to protect the female and to make her feel safe
and this relationship has sort of two sides to it
has grown into a evolutionary advantage that we humans call love
a single male and a single female
this bond between
and mankind figured out how to wipe out whole other species
and humans stood up straighter
so as time evolved
hehe like a parasitic relationship between a symbiote and a host
that male would defend the female
giving him sex
and essentially
that by befriending a single male
females eventually started to learn
which is, i might add, frighteningly similar to ours
so in this society
then they will both ALWAYS outnumber any one person by his or her self
if two people trust each other
for instance
he/she can benefit in many ways
called "friends" in our language
that if he trusts other beings
homo erectus has learned
so meanwhile while all this has been happening
i think we all know what's going to happen
and a male wants sex
if a female has nobody to protect her
females were essentially "preyed" on by males
so now let's look at females
although i guess that hasn't changed much
right
sex?
males needed what
the way society kinda worked was
way
in the early homo erectus
when you think of humans
soo
hehe xD
back when everything was a lot more simple
so let's go back to the caveman era
slightly farther back though
going*
haha that's sorta where i was goiong
okay so
really?
is really really really depressing
the only conclusion i've came to
i've thought about it alot though haha
i don't really know the answer to that
haha you're trying to get at why love and sex whould be intertwined?
i'd regret it if it wasn't someone who i really loved
it'll just be something you always remember
no it's not traumatic
it has to like stick with you in a good way
when something really really GOOD happens
the other way around
its like
it like scars you?
you know how when something traumatic happens
like
i don't know
i think they'res a social pressure to make it special
i don't know
and i know i wouldn't regret it
and it makes both people happy
because it's fun?
not sex though
i'd probably get with someone right now
definitely no haha
at this exact moment
no i don't think there's really anyone i would with
with whom?
then i wouldn't really be alone
i think i could go insane really easily
haha last time you asked i said no it's still no
hehe you're funny when you're high-ish
ruh-roh
yeah haha
i feel a connection with the World of Warcraft gorrilla
i love that video
that onee
YES haha
did you ever listen to that youtube link i sent?
<3 haha
yeah haha physics and computer science..
then again most people don't share our interests hehe
most people tend to lose interest in my conversation topics quick
and aww thanks
haha yeah that does happen
it's okay if i bore you sometimes :)
but still you're a pretty good listener
i realize i bore you a lot
idk i think i kinda need someone to talk to too
you're pretty unique
i mean
*will
i don't think i wil
i promise i'll never ditch you
well you have me to talk to :)
honestly i can't imagine the thought of not wanting someone
idk
blah i'm sorry but i feel
and you do to males?
but you're heteromantic right?
it seems like you just want someone to talk to
like i mean i'm not asking if you're a lesbian
are you sure you like guys?
aw
hahah yeah it really can be
that doesn't appeal to you?
with a moat and drawbridge
like your own little personal castle
haha
it's supposed to make you feel safe
haha i know what you mean
really?
yeah?
nooo i wanna be like a cuddly fuzzy stuffed animal
haha damnit!
i really wanna be described as warm and fuzzy
and i was like wow
this one
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4Wy7gRGgeA

that's my new life goal
i want someone to describe me as warm and fuzzy
tehe

same like three weeks
i guess all the girls are all jealous
i guess that's your decision
hmm

it iss
she's an industrial neo-classicist
and Emily Autumn
yeah :/ i know how that feels
well she's not a favorite but one i really likee
one of my favorite musicians is asexual
actually it mighta been a dude i wasn't really paying a ton of attention
my mom had a bestfriend that had no sexual desire till she was in her 20's
eh it's not that great
*feeling
hehe it's a weird feelin
but yeah i think asexual people are better off then non-asexuals
sex is very complicated
i agree
LOL
do you ever wish you were heterosexual?
yeah
how so?
meh yeah breakups do suck
does that bother you?
what about holding hands?
kissing guys haha?
what i don't get is that you say you don't like relationships...
bleh
maybe he's just
i mean
nooo
nah but you're really pretty
no comment LOL
haha you don't have to worry about being pretty
idk i don't think she's that pretty
i'd believe that
yess she does
in some she looks cute in some not so much
it's hard to tell
idk
well
and no she's not too pretty
she has a million selfies
wow she's very insecure
what's her name?
i doubt it
i'm sorry
JK
you should cut her
awww
i guess you're a girl deep down anyway
wow
oh
that's good
oh
i guess you do :( ?
but erm
we didn't have the most glorious relationship
not really
oh wow

her friend and i
girls are evil haha
cuz she and i had a thing
who used to be her best friend
yeah she was horrrrible to this one girl
*talk
she like pounces on girls i tlak to
i don't think so haha
hehe i think she get's jealous
and who also insulted me by saying i live under a rock for not knowing that song...
haha it's the one who reallllllllly likes me
yeah haha she's like who's the girl in your profile pic
and my friend asked about you lol
she like giggles
like if i say something stupid you just stare at mee
yeah but you laugh at funny things
and she laughs too much
nah she's kinda boring and i like know what she's going to say before she says it
most people use attractive in the physical sense
oh wait did you mean like physically attractive or attractive generally?
liberally
haha like a four
she wasn't really that attractive
noooo haha
hahaha yeah
i probably butchered that
i like spontaneaity
and she was kinda predictable
we couldn't really communicate
i didn't really like herr
haha
you look intimidating
yeah?
mmhmm
went out with Timmy
yep
like she was unnaturally nice
she seemed like she liked mee
oh yeah that was obvious at first haha
really 0.0 ?
i actually really like the name Zach
yeah I think you told that to me haha
omg it was so funny
Speaking of alligators I've got one RIGHT HERE!!!
then Jeff was like
and went into his room
speaking of alligators...
Jisan was just like
then our RA

Mary is very merry
Mary is merry
h/o

Mary is very Merry
and my Haiku was
cuz this woman came so we did this thing called Merry times with Mary
haha so we had to write Haikus
and Alligators?
LOL did Jeff and I tell you about the thing with our RA?
haha okay if you say soo
speaking of alligators...
like an alligator lol
but for most people hot people are kinda scary
like i realize for you it's not
you're very attractive jess that's kinda intimidating
idk i think you're intimidating
no i was like afraid you were gay haha
yeah like the first few days i just thought you were really hot
hahaha yeah i mighta said that
totally taking it out of context
LOL
yeah he told you i liked you he's kinda a dick
yeah i do nooooot like that kid
ah okay if you ever need breathing room please tell me to back off lol
LOL
like do you ever put me in the same category as Yoni?
do you ever think i'm creepy?
*odd
that's a little od
oh wow
yoni macaroni
wow haha
haha apparently too awesome for your own good
you don't suck jess you're awesome
i'm kinda bad at it too
you really shouldn't ask me for advice on this haha
idk
well maybe if for him it's more than friends or nothing....
whether to push him away or let him cling
i feel mean saying this but i feel like you sorta have to choose
then he clings
then you pull him back
then he gets sad
then you push him away
where he like clings to you
hm i feel like you guys are in this vicious circle
you could tell him to back off
then nvm
oh
that's kinda lead-onish
Lol Jess i just went to your wall look at the first post lol
wait nvm his name's sam
jess lol?
with the earring?
is the guy you're married too the one that you said was cute?
normally i would say he means well but he creeps me out too
yeah i guess soo
haha it's a lot of fun until you hurt yourself
snowboard lol
don't ski
Wow lol
haha i'm sure you'd be good
really? aww you should learn and come boarding wiht me haha
i think i already asked you but do you ski or snowboard?
lala
i have faith in you lol
i don't think that'll happen lol
but nah i don't think you'll go crazy
and smuggle you teddy bears
i'll come visit you and make you brownies
hahahaha no it's okay
yeah i try that...
aw i don't wanna be mean
haha we go to the same school and we clash a lot
and she's going with Danny too and we don't get along so well
which always kinda bothers me
and she talks about people that I don't know about
which is good i guess but we don't have a lot in common
like she's awesome but sometimes she never stops talking
welllll to tell the truth Veena is reallllly nice and we used to be best friends like seven years ago but she's a littttle bit annoying sometimes
she keeps trying to get me to go to Dorney Park with a bunch of people i don't remember
do you remember Veena?
ahh jess i do miss you haha
aw <3
hahaha you know people at my school think im ugly lol
jk
LOL
we're both shockingly attractive young geniuses...
in a lot of ways i think were really similar...
thanks :)
i think if more people were more like you we wouldn't have a lot of crap in this world
honestly i respect you a lot
i don't wanna seem annoying
haha noooo not really
i respect them to the point that i don't want to message them cuz i don't want to seem clingy and annoying
like whenever they're on facebook
see with some people
you don't bother me though
i don't know
granted you might be a little sadistic sometimess
that's ridiculous
*there
i think there really are good people out ther
there are plenty of good reasons to give up on humanity...for example zipper-on ties...but just one guy being not who you thought...
aww just cuz one guy isn't who you think he is doesn't mean you should give up on humanity
hmm?
haha you're all zebras...
i loved him he was the best
?
who gave the speech about life and stuff
the black guy?
woah he came to our school too lol
do you know that poem? I'm Still Here or something?
i realize i probably don't help but i'm still here
if you ever want to talk to someone i'm heree
and religion and love and that stuff
well he and I talked about philosophy a lot and life and death
now that i think about it you remind me a lot of him
he's probably one of the most intelligent people i know

they hit it off well i think
maybe he'd like her?
and she's obsessed with asian guys
not like CTY friends
didn't like her
like my friends from school
nooonononon
that's like what guys do
well she loves asian guys and part of the duty of being a guy friend is hooking up friends with girls?
but i think that happens to a lot of guys just most don't back out until much later on
yeah i guess people seem more attractive when you have a boner :/ i realize that seems gross
but part of the reason was all my friends didn't like her
and like i thought i liked her
sexual person
very
she was just a very
well i didn't really like her
mean to back out?
she's like realllllly good
yessss
but we got like close and we almost went out and i sorta got cold feet and backed out
like we never did anything
i was a bit of a manslut back then
she and i sorta had a thing a long time ago
yeah...
Emily?
Jeff texts her...
haha you know Emily Erwin...

it's funny
no haha
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYWQAg12Ko0
lolololol i was gonna send you a youtube clip but i think you'd find it inappropriate haha
have you seen American Pie lol?
LOL
yeah that might happen to me too
lol
480
4* bars
i'm already 135 lol
buy all my own food i'd get fat
although i feel like if i could like
but yeah they're good
3 1/2 now
i've eaten three nutrigrain bars tonight lololol
nooooooo haha
lol
win
haha do i bore you :)
not all...
most yeah
yeah that's gonna get annoying
BANANAs
like if someone just randomly keeps yelling
but every now and then people just find ingenious ways to keep surprising
idk how people do it
what they're going to say next
idk with a lot of people i know like
idk
or maybe reverse
surprising is #1 communication is #2 i think
yeah
and when people surprise me
but how well i can communicate with someone is probably the biggest
by first impression i think so
haha do you
get rich
i feel like it would just rub everywhere
like would chalk work?
yeah i don't think it's easy though
that says something about me
at first i thought you meant developing for the .net framework
wow
yeah apparently like he would go and draw on the walls randomly and they're just like w.e it's cool
but anyway
he was a teacher at princeton
supposedly my relative was friends with him
haha you're welcome
i think you have a healthy position on that line so i wouldn't worry terribly much
"John Nash"
and i guess there is a line between normal and like
jk but i think you're a good person
no
that's why i'm here!
like jump off a cliff
it's like when i'm really afraid you're going to do something stupid
sometimes you get in scary moods
freaky and prodigal are like oderous and smelly they refer to pretty much the same thing they just have kinda different connotations
yeah but i think freaky has like a bad connotation
cuz you are but in a good way :)
like i've sorta gotten past telling you your not weird
aw i like your freakyness
gah
thank you haha
they are funky
like i know how to do that whenever i do though i feel like im creeping on them
hmm
what makes you say that?
do i really seem gay?
they just never seem to like stick
i meet lot's of cute girls who seem interested in first
idk
oh woops i knew that
how do you spell that word?
i just think fundementally there's some part of me that scares girls away
haha it's cool
yerp
yeah i thought it was more my decision but now i realize i think she wanted it like that cuz she was hitting it off with another guy
and i felt like if it became official it would all go to hell like it did last time
well she's my ex
yeah i guess
i'd call it fwb but that sounds kinda pervy
but we went out and DID things we just didn't want to make it official
going out and bf/gf are sort of synonomous
idk in this day in age
so was i haha
idk i just never referred to her as my gf
yeah hahah i mean we did like the stuff bf/gf do
basically a girlfriend except she just stopped talking to me
and she came over to my house a few times
like we hung out a lot and talked and had long skype convo's
idk really
but like last "anything" like at the beginning of the summer
well over a year since my last girlfriend
like official girlfriend
hmm define a relationship
here
and the floor's brown
yes it is
i get looking at a space on the wall and am like transfixed
it happens to me really early in the morning and late at night
doing what?
wow that seems to me like it could be a seriously exploited loophole
lol he's outside...get him!
lololol see if everyone used our logic...
then that means you can't go out at all lololololololololol
if you can't be out AFTER 12:00
and that's the start of a new day
it's 12:00 AM
and technically
is 12:00
since midnight
so
wait ready listen to this
so wait
actually beginning of the day
that means you can't be outside at all
tf?
12:00 is the end of the day
wait
oh freaky
cuz when you have a permit you can't be out past some time
really?
lol
oh that's for driving
wow
maybe it's earlier in Souderton
wow i feel stupid
lol
i thought that was just in Souderton
is that everywhere?
but yes ima go do it
ahahaha jess that's called kidnapping and probably assault
LOL
yeah but then the next day you wake up like wtf??
wow how the hell did we get here
like i just want to sit on the couch with someone and just stay up till like 4:30 in the morning and be like
yeah haha
most people are stupid
honestly what i really want is to just have someone to talk to
maybe
like whenever i have the oppurtunity for a senseless hookup im like meh...
i like can't though
maybe i wouldn't be lonely
like that ryan kid
i kinda wish i was like one of those guys that hooks up with girls
and i'm like bleh i wish i had that
just movies with romance in it
like not romance movies
idk i watch all these romantic movies
blah i wish i had a gf
hehe :) im bored
ur still up?
yeah its sick
its epic

oh wow
hmm is your sister the same way at al?
and i feel bad cuz i have to be nice to her but i feel like im betraying my friend

hehe xD whatsup
jesssy
haha im vidchatting with jeff and tae woo and dwyer and nomuun
they hate you lol
aww !! haha
my friends tease me cuz i jump lol
hahaha you're weird but i guess that's a girl thing
cuz thats what ppl do?
brb
haha a boyyy
aww watch it with a friend
and today i watched Silent Hill and part of another horror film i forget the name
yesterday i watched Saw and Paranormal Activity Two
lol me neither but with friends i love them
it is i loved the movie though
its so cool
i loove it haha
yeah i love that i think the way they move is sooo cool
btw its creepy if you get scared don't watch it
found it
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLb_M3G6Iv8
it makes it look kind of reality-show ish
like the camera either has a high framerate or high definition
although it's filmed in a camera that makes it look weird
GREAT MOVIE though
hmm can't find it
its amazing ill ssee if i can find a clip
and like they sorta move in a really cool way like they're almost dancing
that can only move when lights on them
where there's a bunch of like these monsters
there's a really good scene
in the cold filter
and then the girl and the woman sitting on the couch
and at the end you see the father sitting at home in the couch with the warm filter
and a warm filter on the father
a cold filter on the mom and the little girl
they go between like
throughout the whole movie
it's interesting because
you don't really know
i guess
are happy?
but they like
but the dad doesnt see them, and they cant see the dad
and come into the house
both escape the town
the mom and her adopted daughter
but it's a happy ending thouogh
it was sad
in the end you figure out that both the blonde woman and her "daughter" were both killed in the crash
they decide that they want to kill her too
and since she looks just like her grandmother
but the church finds her first
and she has to go find her
her daughter is gone
and when the blonde woman wakes up
they crash in a car
when they go the town
and the woman's daughter
she caused horrible demon creatures to come out at night
haunted the place
and the spirit of the "witch" who was burned but didn't actually die
the church stayed there
and when the fires caused the evacuation
that accused people of witchcraft
not christian faith
well there was a church
when she was a little girl
was killed for supposed witchcraft
who likes exactly like her
turns out her grandma
the ending is like the one in the Sixth Sense
and the mother takes her daughter into the town to figure out where her nightmares are coming from
who's adopted
and this woman with long long blonde hair has this daughter who suffers from nightmares about this town
from an underground fire
it's about this ghost town where everyone had to leave
it's really creepy
hahaha have you seen Silent Hill
looking for a metaphorical journey to epiphany jess?
hmm
what's it about
yehp
i find that obnoxious though
some people prefer wall convos
i've seen both i like to comment though
ahh so sick
i love it
and the white part starts glowing purple
i walk into my room
white and black pajamas
so im wearing like
omg
brb for like 10 min
i got hit by a branch once
every single way you could possibly hurt yourself on a bike i have
damn
really?
haha i have...
you need a helmet xD
ow lol
haha
yes you certainly are
that's like 65% his fault 35 % yours
haha
not you him
haha idiot...
how!?
bleh wish there was something i could do
using that logic i can go and slap someone be like hey its his fault
that's stupid thats like shooting someone and saying it's their fault for dying
woorps
you shouldn't have to death with someone else's bs
blah i'm so sorry
yeah i guess that is kind of ridiculous
oh :(
what're they fighting over?
good i guess
how are you feeling?
hey jess
hmm i guess that would describe him
it's like the tragedy of the commmons everyones dominatn strategy is to not be open
yeah then why do you want someone like that?
no reason to not be open about who you are
was that i think that you have like
where i *was* going with this
oh wow
just trust me on this lol. if someone said describe yourself in one or two sentences what would you say
describe yourself to me
ok here ready
nah he freaks me out
and he drinks a lot too to add to the issue :/
and he's so agressive towards people
like he always talks about how he wants to kill people
that's one of my biggest fears in life
you know i'm so worried he's going to kill someone
he's getting kind of agressive
and 0.0 my brother's scaring me
how would that go?
"I'm a player" or "I'm a slut"
is because if people just walked around with big signs on their head that said
sorry
*dishonest
i think the reason people are honest about who they are
because they'll get hurt
is that people don't wanna be like that
see the issue here
hm
honestly what do you want in like a person?
hmm
you just need to find the right people
and i'll still message you randomly and you'll respond like every once in a while
i'll never forget about you jess ik you'll probably stop talking to me
but
i'm not helping
which i guess is kind of a bad habit
well you do instinctually trust people
see if everybody were perfect than life would suck even more
and it'll be like CTY every day
so the people are still there and as life progresses you'll find friends
and those people will move on just like you
it's the people that make it great
I mean CTY isn't really a thing
CTY isn't really over
well
what about things like CTY? Don't they make life worth it for you?
I'm not going anywhere soon
is there anything in particular you want to talk about?
is there anything i can do? i hate when your sad
cuz I don't think I can
i'd be a liar
and i feel horrible cuz if I said I know how you feel
jess please don't be
or a giant teddy bear :)
you know that?
you need a dog
what's wrong?
how's life
:) you make me laugh
meh i'm sorry
i do that to everyone it's a bad habit
he's like why do you put the "ooh"
and i said that to someone
you know i was at my friends house
what?
ooh hey jess
pertaining to the why people do what they do answer
which part specifically
what're you thinking about?
hm
haha
like forever
he's stuck in the same day
he tries to kill himself
wow groundhog day is depressing
it's fine
jesssssica
doesn't mean you shouldn't stop trying thoughh
you're probably right
if that was your first bf i'm sure you'll find a better boyy
aww jess you don't suck
aww why would he do that!?
ooh that's hard :(
jess?
minus the cheating thing
was he a good bf?
aw i'm sorry
they're pretty cool though
i wasn't going to say that though
yeah i'm not gonna lie they still freak me out too
zombies
lolololol zombies used to freak me out
aww haha
i realize you're being completely serious but it's still kind of comical in my idea
aww :) i find that funny in an odd way
haha still scared of cannibals
did you finish Real Time?
nah not at all
boring day programming
and I mean would you rather it be a girl that you didn't like?
that's kind of stupid that he'd do that
that's kind of a dick move i guess
i'm sorrry jess :(
bleh i'm sorry
aw why?
how are youu
Jesssss!
brb need to restart comp
meh
i think you're pretty safe
that you get eaten by a cannibal?
that's bad
but yeah that stuff's scary
wow i was just having a convo about this earlier
aww :(
we'll feel pretty stupid
when we're enslaved to giant lizards
who knows
yeah i'm going to have to agree with you on that
then i would feel like an idiot
i feel sorry for claudia
hmm
scary thought though
I mean it could happen
haha
world war z
nuclear winter
yeah
why is it like believable?

haha i had never talked to her though
she thought i was weird and pathetic or something like that?
and i was like "Whaaaat?!?! No!! Devon!!"
and she started telling me this stuff Devon had supposedly said about me
and started spewing this stuff about how like everyone in our grade hated me
at one point Nat got reaaaallllllllly pissed off at me
but anyway
ever = |
something i would like to never repeat, i might add
and at this point in my life, i was kinda like fuckbuddies with Natalie Diamond?
pretty rough year for Tyler

we've had conversations where we totally click
yeah i know haha
haha well i guess we'll see what happens
it's weird cuz i feel like Isabella is super chill
really?
haha who would that be?
haha i think you're her best GA friend
haha she's pretty mean to other people sometimes though
hmm like i like her as a person
haha do you know what she thinks?
i should probably have an answer for that
hmm
i have noooo idea whether to be like super excited or just outright terrified at the thought of an extremely intoxicated Devon
haha uh oh
haha poor Devon
haha pregaming for semi = baaad idea
afterparty*
yeah i'm definitely getting drunk off my ass at that preparty
i live so far from GA though :(
i should actually
i feel compelled to indulge this life of debauchery and moral lowness
haha it's not used up yet
:(
haha hidden in my basement
i feel like that would just be all sorts of hilarious
haha i wanna get him HAMMERED
haha off of one glass of champagne?
really??
haha what???
well liz is russian
yeah champagne is disgusting
haha chris told me that part
oooooh scandalous
how so?
no one explained it to me
what was new years eve like??
oh wait first
NEVER SHAVES
uhmm he's like indian
haha well i know he was gonna ask nancy cui to semi

Chirs + Kevin + Shyam

haha sometimes i have to tell him to cool it
haha he bashes on people a lot
haha oh yes
whaazup
hammertime
i think he was gonna ask nancy cui to semi

chris always bashes on
hmm there's this one guy

and that thick, greasy, curly hair
i love you
and being like

yeaaaaah she's a big'n
and hair that is long overdue for shampooing
just like one giant mess of acne and excessive perfume
how disgusting and greasy their sex must be?
can you even imagine
ughh i don't want to know what they do when they're alone
yeah
like who breaks up over comments on facebook?
hehe
like jesus
i just feel really cold
i don't even feel bad
like when i read those comments

https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=172506309553474&set=pb.100003823175630.-2207520000.1357099395&type=3&theater
check out dese comments
hehe yess
i know i'm goin to hell :(
and put a big bow on her head <3
like just to the point where you can only see her nose
i honestly have considered giftwrapping desi
hehe on that note
and give her a glowing red nose
i know :( i just want to dress her up like a reindeer
under the christmas tree
yeah :( she's in a little ball crying
with a dog
while cuddled up in my bed
no one had successfully managed to make me feel incredibly uncomfortable
but until some unlucky stroke of fate landed me on the page of one Ashley Piszek
see like i always feel mildly uncomfortable when people get excessively close in public
hehehe
yeah!
and you will instantly get that awkward tingly feeling
just try to imagine yourself in that scenario
like how is that not awkward?
"ALRIGHT SOUNDS LIKE A FUCKIN PLAN MIKEY"
"ooh let's take a really awkward four second kiss while looking at the camera so people in the world don't have to only feel awkward when they're around us BUT ALSO WHEN THEY'RE AT HOME CHECKING THEIR NEWSFEEDS"
and one was like
has it ever occurred to you that they were alone
but like
when someone else takes a picture, uploads it, and tags you in it
like it's totally one thing
AGH and people who go out of their way to post pictures of them making out with their boyfriend or girlfriend on facebook
hehe look at me spewing hatred
yeaaaaah haha i hate that in a person
haha didn't Ashley think she was pregnant in like 7th grade or something?
ooooooh Mike
mike - "FUCK YEAH THAT'S A GREAT IDEA!!!!"
like - "WHO WANTS TO RUN INTO A FLAMING BUILDING FOR SEVEN DOLLARS AN HOUR??? ANY TAKERS???"
that is the PERFECT job for him
and it occurred to me
she posted something about him being a firefighter
but urgh i just want to cut his hair
normally i'd feel bad about it
ahahaha yeah it seems to be an ongoing theme with us
i'm sorry
see he's just the sort of person that i have never met, will never meet, and still - i just hate him
AGHHH
I KNOW I SAW THAT
just kill me
two biologically-confused seahorses clinging to each other in some weird twisted contusion of the evolutionary process
that are just like
and those relationships
i'm worried
but
i'm sorry if you like him
he looks mad creepy
a total idiot
or may not be
then i just came to the conclusion that he may
then i was like, i wonder if it's right>
oh my god that's so cool!
i was like
like when i read that
AGH
TOTALLY WRONG
so actually
after which he gives birth to a litter (?) of baby seahorses
who then undergoes a long incubation period
the woman gets the MALE pregnant
and yes you heard me correctly
actually the female impregnates the MALE
they don't "latch" on to each other
second off
they are the whores of the barrier reefs
THAT THEY CAN FIND
SEA HORSE
GODDAMN
sea horses will mate with ANY
first off,
ARE ENTIRELY FALSE
of those claims
all three
hehe <3 as i was saying
not only are the ALL
would realize that
literally anybody that understands the potential of Google
NOW
and third, that the process of one sea horse dying actually kills the other
second, that they latch on to each other in the throes of sexual reproduction
first, that seahorses mate for life
the fellow seems to be making three claims
now let's just look at his little factual blurb
with aforementioned boyfriend
presumably one of aforementioned entertaining conversations
https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=181691788634926&set=t.100003823175630&type=3&theater
haha so i saw this thing in her pictures
haha sooo are you friends with Ashley Piszek on facebook?
with the math, where he was being retarded?
AJ had or something?
well remember you showed me that picture that like
ooh okay haha
haha were you asleep???
hey are you on right now?
haha ;D
haha glad to get that off yo chest
it's 9
haha yeah
rich would be proud
haha ahhhhhh good old days
but we never raped him <3
made him fight 3 zombies to the death
threw cactuses at him i think?
beat him to near death
rebirthed him
killed him
we buried him,
hahahha well let's see
what was his name? richard? haha
haha we might have raped a golem once or twice though?
probably way more time
although, if you think of allllll the time we spent on minecraft
ahahaha yeah that poor guy
but now i feel like i was raped
?
like doesn't that make you feel just disgusting inside>
even though he's violated
i like him though
i know haha
now... i'm going to blow up your... prostate
you tried to blow up my house
hahahaha
haha "BRING ME THAT ASS" kills me
yeah haha i was like f' yeah

sexist means you see them as inferior i guess
mysoginist means you don't respect or don't like girls
chauvenist means rude to girls

but yeah i don't really care about that stuff if i actually like the girl
^big word i learned

so screw all you feminists that say guys just want head
which - by the way - did not keep me from asking her out
on the bright side i don't think she really would have put out

see what the security questions are
forgot my password
and click
i'd go on his account
haha if i were you
yeahhh
with a quarter
haha didn't know a thing about hacking but he achieved the greatest bank heist in the world
Stanley Rifkin
yeah
read that
One day in 1978, Rifkin moseyed over to Security Pacific's authorized-personnelonly wire-transfer room, where the staff sent and received transfers totaling several billion dollars every day. He was working for a company under contract to develop a backup system for the wire room's data in case their main computer ever went down. That role gave him access to the transfer procedures, including how bank officials arranged for a transfer to be sent. He had learned that bank officers who were authorized to order wire transfers would be given a closely guarded daily code each morning to use when calling the wire room. In the wire room the clerks saved themselves the trouble of trying to memorize each day's code: They wrote down the code on a slip of paper and posted it where they could see it easily. This particular November day Rifkin had a specific reason for his visit. He wanted to get a glance at that paper. Arriving in the wire room, he took some notes on operating procedures, supposedly to make sure the backup system would mesh properly with the regular systems. Meanwhile, he surreptitiously read the security code from the posted slip of paper, and memorized it. A few minutes later he walked out. As he said afterward, he felt as if he had just won the lottery. There's This Swiss Bank Account... Leaving the room at about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, he headed straight for the pay phone in the building's marble lobby, where he deposited a coin and dialed into the wire-transfer room. He then changed hats, transforming himself from Stanley Rifkin, bank consultant, into Mike Hansen, a member of the bank's International Department. According to one source, the conversation went something like this: "Hi, this is Mike Hansen in International," he said to the young woman who answered the phone. She asked for the office number. That was standard procedure, and he was prepared: “286” he said. The girl then asked, "Okay, what's the code?" Rifkin has said that his adrenaline-powered heartbeat "picked up its pace" at this point. He responded smoothly, "4789." Then he went on to give instructions for wiring "Ten million, two-hundred thousand dollars exactly" to the Irving Trust Company in New York, for credit of the Wozchod Handels Bank of Zurich, Switzerland, where he had already established an account. The girl then said, "Okay, I got that. And now I need the interoffice settlement number." Rifkin broke out in a sweat; this was a question he hadn't anticipated, something that had slipped through the cracks in his research. But he managed to stay in character, acted as if everything was fine, and on the spot answered without missing a beat, "Let me check; I'll call you right back." He changed hats once again to call another department at the bank, this time claiming to be an employee in the wire-transfer room. He obtained the settlement number and called the girl back. She took the number and said, "Thanks." (Under the circumstances, her thanking him has to be considered highly ironic.)

scores tab
sat.collegeboard.com
backk
hey brb i have to get dressed
hmm we have like an independent research project
just as a fun project and maybe get some school credit
i'm thinking of writing my own virtually run operating system
haha yeah
Internet Explorer
Code::Blocks is i think
alot of the ones i use are
hmm i looked itup i think it might be called VirtualBox
so essentially you're running a windows program from a mac
and the program thinks its running of a windows machine
then you run the windows only program
and first you run Wine
and you can download the program for windows
you get Wine or Yellow Box or whatever
but uhm
i think for mac it's called Yellow Box
you can get Wine
it's only for windows
but unfortunately
and there is this awesome program
your running a mac
and let's say
i think there's a version for mac too
it's very very cool
its like a computer running inside a computer
and partitioning your hard drive means cutting it in half and letting windows use half of it and linux use the other half
you can run a windows program virtually
so even if your computer is linux
which is an emulator for windows that you can install
i believe its called Wine
but there's also something
you would have to redownload
but programs like AIM
the pictures and files and stuff you'd be fine with i think
lemme see for a second hold on
okay
waitt brb
then get rid of windows
you can do that
OR
so when you start up your computer you can choose to run windows or linux
you can partition your hard drive
but you want to try linux
let's say you like windows
you can either partition your hard drive or run it exclusively
theres two ways
hmm my dad uses it on his computer
than windows or mac
yeah and linux runs wayyyy faster
that is free
there's a version that runs on Linux
however
isn't open source
that run on Windows, and Mac
Word, Powerpoint, Excel
the official
nopee
and office isn't free
idk maybe?
thanks
and more importantly to me, open source
is 100% free
any program that runs exclusively on linux
are all free
the word, excel, powerpoint that are made for it
the operating system is free
any person in the world can have for free
that's written for Linux
ANY PROGRAM
and since it's free
but it split like 20 different ways
the same thing happened with linux
well
Windows 7, Windows 98, Windows Vista, Windows XP?
and you know how theres like
took unix and evolved it into Linux
and then a lot of private programming teams
that was NOT open source
took the Unix System and made their own company
Steve Jobs and Mac/Apple
into Linux, and Mac
Unix kinda split
and then what happened was
(when everyone can see the code that makes a program)
that's called open source btw
everyone could see the code that went into it
so basically
and it was released to the public
and it was a pretty good operating system
called Unix
someone came up with an OS (Operating System)
a loooong time ago
the way it works is
like there isn't one linux
linux isn't a corperation
yeah well
all three are operating systems
there's Mac, Windows, and Linux
wow
like do you know what linux is?
yeah
they're so against open source and they're kind of bad computers
is their touchpads are amaaaazing
the only thing good about macs
haha wow
i reallllly don't like it
mac can smd haha
im just playin hearts on my comp :)
hey bro
cya bro
so each letter corresponds to a phonetic sound?

rock on mate (y)
yo mate I gotta do some compsci stuff but I'll hit you up later about saturday
because people are doofuses about it when it comes to politics haha
nah it's cuz all the presidents come from like 3 colleges
I think that's the most popular major at my school
hmm I'll have to read more about it, but convos like this are the reason I could never do Political Science
haha I love that stuff, I might check it out
big brother shit
hmm I looked it up it looks good
not free-for-all anarchy
I could see structured communism working
I don't think communism and leadership are mutually exclusive
some had chiefs, yeah that's true
tribunes
the Incans?
people lived as commies for thousands of years in little tribes and stuff, look at the Incans
haha capitalists have power complexes, so I agree that a capitalist could never be a communist
what makes you say that?
tbh I'm kind of communist
really?
like him, Pat Ledwith, Justin Wong, blows my mind how smart they are
haha maybe if you average it all out though, but that whole sevant-intelligence thing is crazy
he won some international science fair
haha I did those classes as a senior
yeah some kinda brilliant
oh that is super nuts
is he a junior?
yeah some people can do that
oh yeah he is really sart
I think so, why?
yeah, I mean if you like Stat then it's probably pretty closely aligned
nice, nice. love your work man
oh nice, $$ and more $$ haha
$$ on $$
ah nice, Econ is super chill
econ?
haha it's not too bad yet
might change to Compsci or Compsci and Econ
combined Electrical Engineering and CompSci at the moment
I think he got an A or A- but he said it was his hardest class, and he's from a public school
yeah
to put it all in perspective haha
my best bud @Yale is an Electrical Engineering major and he took Physics B and struggled
yeah that's pretty solid, and damn dude that's impressive
yeah AP Physics was by far the hardest class I ever took
AP Physics is like impossible
Physics is super fucking tough
yeah I've heard that
yeah I talked to Scherrer, I think this year is like Claudia Mezey and Trent whateverhisnameis
I think...?
haha he was in it last year
wait B or C?
anyway how yo classes going?
yeah she's hella good, I liked her a lot
he's like next-level smart
yeah 0.0 and yeah
Ledwith
he taught the class whenever our teacher was gone
haha I was pretty good at Stat, Pat was way better though
after senioritis mighta slipped, I know i got a 5 though
yeah something like that
bitch
lol you're one of two or three people she liked from GA
yeah no joke she's like one of two or three people she liked from GA
she got recruited a lot of places
club yeah, she's thinking about walking on to her team though
I got super into soccer over the summer, jess was on an ODP team so she taught me

there's a farm right next to her house with them
and they're alpacas haha
if you've seen that creepy ass movie The Labrynth, it's like that
it's pretty funky, it's a quick first-person shooter, but you can shift gravity along any axis so you can walk on walls and the ceiling and stuff
haha not yet, I'm building a video game though

Seriously man, in five minutes you could make some of the best decisions of your life
My solution? Make a list if everything that makes you unhappy then re evaluate your life
Oh. Hmm maybe it's anxiety
Two year itch?

eric
i'm hoping there could be some good cover-photo material in there
btw when do you think they'll post on hudl?
haha
haha nice guy this one
haha man i have faith he coulda kept it up till the end of the period
he almost got a few takedowns
in the first two periods
in neutral
he was doing well though
and the coaches knew that
atleast on bottom
haha but he does though
going bottom was a 100% pinning scenario for cullen
haha even so
i think worst case he would have gotten minor decision-ed
second i guess actually
yeah man haha the first period he was killing him
and was down 3-2
yeah but he almost got a takedown in neutral
they def should have gone neutral
i have no idea why the coaches had Cullen go bottom
i know haha
but it's still fuckin crazy
i mean it saved us
haha that's so fuckin weird yo
haha were you trying to get taken down?
and def one of the most interesting
and btw your match was probably the strangest one i've ever seen in my life
yo thanks man haha
i didn't know i got a major until like an hour later haha
ah man i can't wait till they post the vids on hudl
his house is fkn sick
oh damn haha
or did they just not know about people drinking
and wait were Neema's parents out?
hahaha yeah man
but i would have rather been at Neemas
haha it was alright
i know man haha
haha yeah i know i was at work though :/
haha that sounds pretty awesome
haha yeah Franco called me and you guys sounded rowdy as shit
hahaha i got a snapchat of wasted Trevor
haha you guys went to Neemas or something right?
i'ma check them out
oh sweet haha
damn haha is there a place where you can find the rankings?
or both haha
i know man haha i'm gonna put one up in my room
yeah haha one spelled my name wrong
hahaha thanks man that was some fine ass wrestling you did too
peace bro
aight man i gotta go
hmm never knew that
something i was never good at
like a good skill
hmm that's a good thing to have
oh that actually sounds pretty good
that story?
did you write it?
letsgoeric
so i figured i'd get my creative nonfiction on
we had to write a 1.5 page essay pertaining to the theme "Strangers in a Strange Land"
Hell weekend from my frosh year
you know the last english paper i did was on wrestling
yes sir that is entirely true
we'll kick ass man
haha
gl
i gotta go to bed
thanks man
alright
fuuuuuuckme
what if you lose your first day?
alright
sweet
and finish?
then come back the 28th right
yah
for that
thank you
gay
is it a hard varsity tournament?
por que?
i am
alright thanks man
hmmm alright sweet if you can find em bring em in yo
really? sweet man what type?
si. por que?
Spanish calls
yo i gotta peace mate
nah that's life
i just pack it up then
haha i usually don't work past 10:30 at the latest
i had to finish a 3-4 page history essay last night
haha that's like me every night
skip practice yo
nope that's GA life bro
that you've got there
that is a true fact
being the heavier guy...
you know practicing with Franco was pretty nice
i missed you too babe <3
then multiply by avogadros... and yeah you got it
same way you did yesterday
so convert grams to moles
NH4- and I+ i think
yeah sounds right
what do you get
when it ionizes
alright well
shoot
fine
can this not be a regular thing
aight peace bro
then convert to molecules
answer: divide by its molecular mass
do you know how to do grams to moles?
yeah that's not quite as easy
aright hurry i'm about to eat dinner...
i always am. did it work?
recheck that bro
how is 6.022 * 10^23 * 6.33 moles have only 11 zeroes after it?
that's because you definitely multiplied that incorrectly...
when you get to calculating how much a reaction yields, it will, but in the scope of that question it doesn't
it shouldn't
noperz
i'm saying multiply 6.33 by avogadro's number
yeah
6.33 * avogadro's number
and make sure you're doing sigfigs correctly
what's the exact question...
brb
a "mole" is just a number, so 1 mole of sodium phosphate is like 6.022*10^23 molecules
multiply 2.67 by avogadros number
so if you just want to know how many Sodium phosphate molecules there are
Avogadro's number
that's like something to the 26th power?
you know that magical number
pretty easy brah
why
i was yeah
gotta go son
you can go hard if you buy me a drink first >: )
yeah i know
ah gay
were there wrestleoffs?
ahaha
right
OOHH THE KID
ok ;)

your answer should go to two places after the decimal

lemme check
so i guess two after the decimal?
then only use as many decimal places as the argument with the least places after decimal
with all the decimal points like above each other
you just line them all up on top of each other
i think with addition

but all my practice tests
yeah haha i know
it'd kinda be a game of roulette
i've never gotten as high on a practice test before
i mean
yeah
do you think i should take it again or is it not really worth it?
i've like gottan an 800 twice before on practice tests
but not as well as i thought i'd do

like she even told me that he tracked down a couple hackers
i find it weird that my teacher recommended him..
yeah goodpoint
someone sees his name on my finished paper
the biggest issue would be
yeah that's not a huge issue
he spent like 90 days in jail
but i mean
i feel like i might wanna cancel him as my mentor
yeah :/
lots of child-porn, tried to get 12 year old guys to strip for him
the hacking didn't really bother me
and they let him off easy because he tracked down a bunch of big-name hackers
he got taken into court
like major online pedophile stuff
like not just hacking shit
dude my mentor did a lot of bad shit
this whole mentor thing is messing with my head
can i tell you something?
holy shit
dude...
yeah that does kinda suck
haha what is the purpose of this project?
calculus too right?
oooooh math!
a lot of open-source game engines use that right?
ooo i know opengl

last year's was pretty easy after iDtech
hmm alright thanks dude
something with XSS would be pretty cool
i'm like fresh out of ideas
any suggestions for anything?
but have no idea how to like apply it
like I sort of know what they are
yeah I feel you
oh dang. do you know anything about like TCP Protocol or SSL or stuff like that?
and SQL Injection is pretty outdated by now right?
a littttle bit about those
hmm i know like
are you into network security?
but i can't like...find anything to do
"Network Security Essentials: Applications and Standards" by William Stallings
so i got the book
and i realllllllly want to do something network security related
like compsi related
yo dude so i've been thinking up a good project
haha you're a great example :D

http://pinterest.com/sourkisses/my-boys/

hahaha alright man
screw you china
fuck yeah
which i realize i shouldn't advocate haha
:/
unless they're like super thin
haha tall girls don't really do it for me either
i just naturally hate him before the conversation starts haha
like when i meet a tall guy
i instinctively just dislike tall guys haha
yeah he is pretty ripped
haha fangirl lmfao
ahahahaha that's hilarious
lmao he's like England's sweetheart
did you see the little documentary on him at the beginning?
haha that's probably it
haha it never occured to me why you need to be ripped to be a diver
he also might have some muscle on me... haha
and un-gelled
yeah haha you've only seen mine short
i got two comments that Sam Mikulak looks like me
not sure why diver is capitalized
haha the English Diver
hmm i think guys gymnastics is freaking badass
haha honestly i hate volleyball
ergh that's dissapointing

ooo what event?
haha sounds very chill
whatsup man?
haha that's epic

YEAH BOI
what color are you doing yours
like explosive lime green
please do it bright green
you buying it?
mine were like four dollars?
yeah haha i agree
haha gotta love em
haha my knockoff ray bans
atleast we get to start building our own little empire way earlier
haha yeah i guess
you lose like a third of your life
i don't know if it's work it
yeah haha
and they get pretty loaded
haha it is pretty nice
haha my brother being one of them
and you have to work around sick people all day
which could take 15 years
until you find a great specialty
you never get any time off
30
you start working when you're like
i know right?
dude being a doctor would be the worst freaking job ever
ugh just be glad you're not a doctor haha
so how's work man?
hahaha gotta love community colleges
so it's not like she's away
well i think she's going to a community college
exactly
or one is under 18 and there is more than 4 years between them
one of them is UNDER 13
it's okay UNLESS
the rule states
*i looked it up
i looked it u
NOT IN PA
that's a good point
yerp
would it be socially unacceptable for me to go out with an 18 year old girl?
just curious on your thoughts
hey dude
haha it's a pretty good song though
woah i love that song
goodnight man don't stay up too late haha
ill ttyl
alright man i'm getting up early tomorrow
ah man that's awesome
it's just hidden in an executable
is there like a file extension that dictates that it's assembly haha?
*extension
so what is the file extensio haha?
are they not synonomous?
that might have been native to the IDE though
it was in some file type
and i got like a hello world
lol i remember when i did my assembly stuff
what format is a binary file in?
hmm
so our computers could use the exact same assembly code?
how do you know what assem language your computer uses>?
hmmm
what computers use it?
what's MIPS?
and like reverse engineering
i used to be addicted to OllyDBG
like assem and stuff
i also love low down structure
yeah it's pretty fascinating
is it recent?
what'sat?
yeah i read about them a lot
do you have them?
which is pretty sweet
to cut down on loading times
and i know it uses Just In Time compiling
i get the impression it's pretty similar to the JVM
like whether to use the .NET framework?
really?
is there like a "JVM" that handles all that?
?
so what interprets a .exe
and C++ is OO?
C is technically procedural right?
hahaha life is written in C
"data link libraries"
so all it's "native functions" to use java lingo are really from system32 dlls?
okay...
with a bunch of external libraries and resources etc.
having to be installed and self extracting
as opposed to like
i thought that just meant it was Binary?
i've heard of that before
oh i
is that binary?
googlechrome.exe or whatever
say...
so is like
hmm
cuz i get that whole jawn
CLR haha?
like .Net stuff?
okay sweet haha
tell me if i'm using any words incorrectly btw
why is it you can distribute Binary on computers with Windows if they have different chips?
what about like Windows?
that's sweet haha
really?
even if we have like the same OS it might not work?
and send it to you
if i write a program in my computer's assembly
*mean
so does that mena
that's what i'm getting at haha
what's the language that the human reads/writes?
or whatever it is that turns opcodes to binary
but i know a lot of "simulators"
one assembly
so there's only like
oh wait i got it
that turns it to assembly
compiler called
but what's the like
yeah i get that part
yessss
exactly
mov eax blah blah blah jmp
but then humans can write like
yeah assembly is basically just hex right?
or what is the compiler
what's the program you use as an IDE
herm
like
it's not like a compiler though...
you have to use something to like "compile" it back and forth
like there's not just one x86 language
do you know what i'm talking about haha?
can't think of them
damn
like fam-something
hold on
shit i forget the names
there's all those like weird variations
what x86 language do you use?
have you ever done assembly?
haha procedural programming ftw
there we go
PROCEDURAL
shit what's the word...
linear's not the word
isn't that like sort of like a middle ground between object-oriented and just linear?
i sort of know functional programming
what'sat mean?
like are they just diff languages?
what are they like for?
i've heard of LaTeX or whatever
never even heard of Racket/Scala/ML
what courses are you going to TA?
oh no haha that's awesome though
and i'm still listening to that song
who's visiting?
lol just burst out laughing on this end
haha I feel like you should have lost any and all sense of modesty to sing about this much panty dropping
lol i heard this song like five years ago and i still feel like i'm too young
hahaha like i feel dirty listening to it
it's great
lol i know right
then it's less that
if "Jeffree Star" is an adjective
i don't even know the word haha
not quite as
hahaha it's catchy as hell
haha have you heard "Fer Sure"? Reminds me a lot of that
wow the end
yeah that's the sort of thing where i usually just pretend to know what they're talking about
yeah hahaha
the screamo part's kinda catchy
ahahaha yeah i agree
the voice kicked in
never mind
oop
haha pretty catchy so far
ahahahaha lmfao
attention-seeking
which is like my number one pet peeve
yes
ahaha yeah i have the feeling she warped that story even as it was
HE CHEATED ON HIS GIRLFRIEND WITH ME
haha i remember that
are you doing Splash next year?
haha that didn't go too well though
haha mine was at Splash
i forget his name haha
Frednick
that was Frederich
hmmm at iDTech?
lmao get a tophat
haha
like grrr
haha like i feel to be with a girl they can't be over a certain height
girl-hormones phase
haha if i could i'd just skip the whole
hahaha yeah
hahaha idk the thing that kills me is that girls hate it
being fun-sized is a curse
that's actually hilarious
rofl
hahaha yeah i freakin hate it
lmao
hahaha the worst thing is being short haha
like wow i actually hate highschool haha
i'm more concerned with just getting the hell out of highschool
but i mean getting to a good college is great
ahahaha yeah
that's what college is for
being a kid sucks in high school
really?
haha junior year is supposed to suck
idk how i'm gonna do two more weeks of this
haha it's like longer than school man
out of 23 i think
haha like four people have dropped out already
my EMT course is inTENSE
haha pretty cool
LOL coding angst
and you finally get not one debug error...
haha dude that feeling when you finally finish like 8 hours of debugging
that's why it's a great carreer
that's awesome haha
haha i needed to hear that
haha i think it's the SAT and all that's honed me
man it kills me
but when people switch adverbs and adjectives...
"it's me"
and i'm okay with like
because i realize the whole he/she thing is just long and awkward
"If somebody is hungry, they should eat"
like i'm okay with
my teachers always do that
like how do you know get that?
i just like explode inside
"You all did really good"
whenever I hear
haha because like
are you like, a grammar nazi?
i play that song while i'm coding :D
*fast
haha codemonkey get up get breakfaswt
it's funny as hell
haha probably i've still seen a few episodes
i love the show too
ahaha yes
code monkey?
ahaha you know that song?
are you just like a codemonkey?
that sounds awesome!
what sort of work are you doing?
ahhh man i hate that haha
hey man how's your summer going
hahaha i just cracked up
hahaha ride the lightening my friend
why?
also he said you should consider a used Ninja 500r
and it's his desktop background
and he said it's his favorite bike
haha i told my bro you wanted a kawasaki ninja 250r
he always complains about that
haha dude you would love my brother
wouldn't they slip a lot more then?
idk why they haven't
and my dad's like pretty much a mechanic
haha my brother is replacing the transmission on the automatic by hand
like you have to like put all your weight on it
hahaha the problem I have is that my mom's car has a clutch that's messed up beyond belief
and driving a manual is a lot of fun
i need to try it haha
hmm
haha so then how do you do the brake?
oh yeah
foot pedal?
how do you activate the clutch
hmm i suppose it doesn't sound that hard
ahhh
can you stall it?
really?
i can drive manual
on a bike haha
hahaha is shifting hard?
hahaha i'd probably kill myself i'm an idiot on that sort of stuff
can't say I've tried it
haha is it?
ahahaa i know damnit!
How annoying is that? haha
"It doesn't! They're completely the same!"
and the answer, on the next page is
"How does the href attribute differ for these to html pages?"
there's this question
in this HTML book
*funny
alright i thought this was really fufnny
I guess you're right
because i see people getting 800s a lot haha
it's kinda bad in a private school
you think so?
then a 750 on the real thing
i got everything from a 590 to like a 730
it was weird
maybe seven?
i did like 6
i think i had princeton, but i did do some barrons ones
most of them 690
which freaked me out cuz my practice tests were like maxing at 730
oh btw i got a 750 on the chem SATII
and i'm within 100 of those grades
alright i have the grades down
haha endgoal!
haha now i'm pretty excited for college
yeah i guess
like how would i know?
haha i'm afraid i'm borderline
haha supposedly if you're borderline insane they push you over the edge?
haha i think shrooms would ruin me
actually i have no idea
hahaha shrooms? damn even my brother's not that hardcore
haha most definitely not
he brings plenty of the college life back home
nah don't worry my bro's in college
i get two weeks
alright man do you think i can over spring break or something?
when can i?
haha you've accomplished your job well then
but more as in very tolerant
or apathetic
as in lethargic
don't care
i mean not like
yeah man haha
yeaaaah haha i can see that
but like a nice sportsbike
i can't really think of anyone as a harley person
a HARLEY person
i mean i don't mean like
hahaha carefree man
yeah dude you so are a motorcycle person!
maaaan i can totally see you on a motorcycle
really haha?
i'm debarking on a long and exciting journey to be an EMT
but i won't for a while
haha I can get it in like five days
ahahah yeah I need to work on my professionality
i say screw python...
it has like the most simple clean code
ikr haha?
so all i have to do now is learn what libraries are included in the browser interpreter
all game engines use it as a scripting language
haha fun story I learned all the javascript syntax when i was into game development
really?
then learn some Network Security and at the same time do some server-side stuff like maybe PHP or stuff
learn HTML/XHTML/CSS
my goals right now are
haha what do you think i should tackle next?
EJB = Enterprise Java Beans
if that's what it's about
I haven't gotten into Java Beans or Jini or EJB or Jave EE at all
man all I have right now is Java down pretty solid
haha I doubt it
plus that looks soooo good at science fair haha
althrough at the moment network security could give me that opportunity
I'd be doing something much more low level
but if I could have it my way
That's probably where I'll end up
and i had no idea how to automate because i didn't understand anything
until I started working on a webbot
i always assumed actually knowing HTML was useless
from attributes to backend Apache Velocity applications
haha you've got a pretty far lead on me mate
hmm lost me there
doesn't that just sound like an applet?
software side
Apache develops webservers right?
hmm let me see if i can understand that
haha somehow i never learned it
i'm going back now and relearning HTML
haha how relevant
what do you do?
really? oh sweet haha
haha atleast us CS majors
Yeah but I mean eventually we all end up there
didn't you have mixed feelings about it?
really?
Zach.
later man
w/e man i just gotta stop thinking about it
like i forget which one is the rate law or whatever
it's literally the vocab that's getting me
i still have a week but still
690
haha dude 690
that miiiiiight not happen ahaha
haha well considering the grades i'm getting on my SATII's atm
i'm gonna peace out
aight man i got school tomorrow
chillest city there is
i stayed in boston at splash
haha i know
i know
haha it is all bad
that wasn't too bad
i used to live in souderton
Perkiomenville is just the worst
hahaha dude i hate where i live
and perkiomen valley confused
upper perkiomen
i get perkiomenville
ahhh right
oh yeah you're from Perkiomenville
you know Hill school?
haha yeah
but i decided not to go ha
and they loved me on the interview
i applied to the Hill School
well i'd hope so atleast
?
and you think its more the other things
everywhere i guess though
haha that's like
haha alright so if i go to brown i can work there...sweet
you have to have worked with kids before?
are there requirements like
atleast its not hard work
haha
wow
haha how do they train you?
i guess you atleast get to get a lot of work hours in
haha really?!
overall?
was it fun?
is kind of priceless
the feeling of leaving an impression
yeah
and pizza
after like 4 hours of debugging
haha that feeling when not one of the single debug() errors gets through
the second week was much better
haha yeah
haha i know but some of them were horrible
honestly i probably would have if i had been teaching
and you taught at IDTech so you know exactly how that feels
i'm just going to accidently hit one 0.0
haha i'm really really really afraid
haha it'll be little kids though
that'll be my main income
teaching piano too
haha yeah
and i can't do that during the summer or the year
haha you have to work like consistently
yeah haha no way i'll be able to get on a payroll
July*
haha i will in JULY
haha i'm an EMT this summer
i wish i could do something like that haha
that's pretty awesome for a summer internship...
wow that's awesome
what do you do by the way?
that sounds awesome man haha
hmm wasn't planning on it but i can
at Brown?
haha highschool is soo horrible
ahh man i can't wait for that
haha that's awesome dude i'm jealous
and i'll be where you are pretty soon
like that you've already got your own place
wow that's actually kind of a weird thought
ahh gotcha
studio?
really?! you get an apartment?
oh wow that's sick
haha they let people do that?
haha dude i actually gotta visit brown sometime
haha dude i really need to
i actually didn't get much of an impression from them
ahaha definitely
some tall girl who ran track
hrmm i never got her name
she said she didn't think so but she knew a lot of guys from compsci
yeah i asked her if she knew you
and i talked to the girl for a while
and Brown was there
you know there was a college fair at the academy
and raping netflix
so i'm just eating
studying isn't going to do much good
that like
right now i've got the mindset
yeah just starting now :/
if it didn't i'd be on that too
haha that shit messes me up
yeah that
yeah
and like messed up from lack of sleep
and weird from a weeklong sugar crash
and by the end you feel fat
then that amount of time you can't be studying
and make something to eat
but you know if you sit down
but you're not hungry
where you just eat
SATIIs
before exams
haha so do you remember that week in highschool
ZACH
she complained that she has to type them in from her cookbook
?
weren't you doing a project with something like that
btw my mom was complaining about her cooking recipe software
haha that's a pretty good deal i hear
Highschool is such shit
ahh man i can't wait for the college scene
yeah i hear that goes on a lot
have carefree one-nighters lol
you can have parties
great thing about having a single
yeahhhhhhh
kudos for going single
haha i don't think i've ever had a roommate at all of my camps that i've enjoyed
yeah i agree
made the rest of my stay slightly awkward
well my roommate was bi and he sorta made a pass at me
that's good haha
heterosexuality frowned upon and homosexuality embraced
the reverse of normal society
it was like
like it wasn't equality of sexual preference
but there was actually pressure to swing that way
yeah i agree it's great
they'd feel homophobic to stop it
if its a guy and a guy
yeah because if its a guy and a girl they get reprimanded
and they have really really really bizarre "traditions"
but it's like really normal to see a guy and a guy or a girl and a girl going at it
it's really bizarre if you see a guy and a girl hooking up
atleast the lancaster one
at CTY
like it's weird
like almost too much
they're like super liberal
CTY kids are not like normal kids
i'm inclined to warn you
has he ever taught highschoolers/junior highschoolers
hahaha it's pretty interesting course
he's probably teaching right?
it was pretty basic
i'm glad i didn't
i looked at the compsci course
yeah i know
haha ironically i didn't even touch coding while i was there
well my course was on game theory
it's at Franklin and Marshall
haha i think it's the only one in PA
ooo Lancaster?
which location?
woahhh really?
ZACHARY
same bro
zZZzZZzZzzzzzzZZZZ i'll ttyl man
he's out of control
haha
like my bro
unless you're a bioengineering major
yeah haha
alright haha i'll get the inside look for a change
haha thanks man my bro was gonna make me sleep on the corner of his room at lehigh that sounds way better actually
really? haha i'm so down with that
such a well rounded school haha
yeah man i gotta get in on the brown scene its too much to pass up
yeah definitely
haha maybe i can get my "in" at last
haha i'll hit you up when i follow up with the guy
haha dude i'm so tired idk if i'm even makin sense
i could be wrong though
i thought the pedaled ones did
uhm i'm far from an expert but i think some ultralights do?
haha my dad's got a pilots license
yeah you're kinda at nature's mercy there
which really does not make sense to me
cuz there are like no laws restricting it
lmao i wanted to do ultralight when i was a kid
and yerp
you can get an ultralight with no hours
like really suck
or like 200 if you suck
of flight
you can get it with 15 hours
get your license man
haha i was never huge into planes
lmao
is it pathetic that i never made that connection?
oo looked it up yeah they are
because they do a lot of commercial stuff
i've always kinda wondered that
does Boeing have heavy military associations?
build the next hindenburg
hahahahaha exactly
like pretty much 90% of work in the aerospace engineering field is military related
yeah haha
it's basically working for the military
haha they're probably a pretty secretive bunch
yeah haha although i doubt they offer them
and maybe stay in touch to see if i can intern or something
and see if he can work it into one of his projects or something
maybe make it good enough to implement realistically
he and i develop the program more
maybe
honestly i see best case scenario
*lockheed martin
anyway what do you think i should do about the lockheed and martin thing
i can't wait for that college stuff
haha damn dude
when midnight was like late
yeah haha remember highschool
oh sweet haha
haha you're on?
aight man i think i'm hitting the sack i'll be dead for school tomorrow
you need tab and fritos
holy shit man that's going to bring down your debugging efficiency
haha i'll do my best to stay up
alright i'll be up hopefully
what'd you have in mind?
i can be
like how should i follow through?
dude i need to
what should i do?
YES I KNOW
i was like uhhh i was planning on making it open source but i doubted anyone would care
haha he asked if i was going to release the code
he gave me his email
YEAH SHIT SON
MY PROJECT COULD BE RUNNING THE DATA MANAGEMENT FOR A US BATTLESHIP
and second off, and this is the guy that's developed software components for the Blackbird and is now working on one for a BATTLESHIP, he thinks that he might want to use components from my project in some of the stuff he's doing now
that my project was far more complex than any experiment he had ever seen at my level
first off he said
literally
and this guy is like reading through my project
and i come over to my posterboard
and literally i'm talking to some frosh girls
the shit
this guy is like
Tai Nguyen, Integrated Product Team and Software Lead at Lockheed Martin, was judging science projects at the delaware valley regional science fair competition
alright
one of the most intellectual but yet most chill schools in the US
it is brown ;D
but then again
yeah it is brown haha
i guess xD
and college classes ftw too hehe
that's sick haha college parties ftw
alright sweet haha
lmfao i've slept on way worse than that man don't worry about it
woah really? yo i'm taking you up on that
hahaha dude that'd be so sick
ohhh haha dude either way i'm looking forward to college
haha alright, the advantage of not being able to legally drive :)
ahaha yeah that's the one advantage of not being in a dorm
lmao i watched four hours of the office last night
or maybe im a fucking masochist ahahaha
you can like trick your brain into wanting to learn
it's actually freaky
hahaha dude do you know what i do? watch an hour of mind numbing television or netflix and you're brain will crave coding again
haha by the end my whole data structure looked like a mess of a thousand //System.out.println
1 hour of exciting development and enrichment and another 3 of boring ass debugging
haha that's usually the way it is in compsci
haha you know i'm so proud of my self for having a clue what that means
but i'm actually pretty happy with the results
i lead such an exciting life
and still have to make a powerpoint on this crap
lmfao speaking of which i get up in a little over three hours for a wrestling tournament
on the scale of like 10000 ish indexes
and in indexing with the like "get()" method, mine was on average about twice as fast
as fast as possible
this was on the scale of 500 additions
well, 40-50 times faster
the ArrayList did about 40-50 times better on average
like the add() method
in adding
but anyway
woah that might help me
Eyy by the way i tested my data structure against the standard java SE arraylist
so i deeply hope your endeavors gather more success than have mine
haha i spent the last two months of my life chasing after a girl in vain
ahahaha nice man best of luck with that
rough haha
spent the whole day finishing my science fair prototype
got up this morning at eleven
Hey dude i just spent the last 14 hours coding or eating.
pce out
FL's mah bitch
haha FL Studio <3
haha thanks
or Pro tools or wateva
or FL or Cubase or Logic
aite man good luck with Ableton
best deal ever
i just play whatever random shit comes into my head and people tip me!
yeah i play at the Skippack First Friday thing
like i can talk and improv at the same time now
haha i have no talent but after a while you get like fluent. like its as easy as holding a conversation
and writing
and improvs my thing too
im yo man
if you eva need any work on keyboards
im a fuckin boss at keys
haha man im not gonna lie
you do any keys?
woah nice
i bought some and they turned out to be crap
haha idk where my MIDI cables are
good luk on winter break
thanks man you too
early as in 8:30
gettin up early for lifting
alright dude i gotta go
i forget
damn
what was it...
i just had a really good idea for one today
yeah
when in reality i just blindly follow orders
and dedication
ill probably talk about wrestling
yeah i guess soo
i feel like all of mine will be total bullshit
oh haha
for the college or for the kid?
woah thats awesome
really?
thats coming up soon
oh joy
but i still have a year
i got like 96
yeah
haha
its prestigious
nice im jealous haha
sick dude haha
woah really?
it was a PPSAT
and actualy it wasn't a PSAT
did you get national merit?
hahahaha
a 200 on PSAT aint going to cut it
if im goin for a 2300
we're smart haha
but like lets be honest
200 haha
did soooo horribly
i took the PSAT
idk
i might
ahahaha
so hes kinda fucked on it
and he didnt learn english till he was like 5
haha my best friends korean
yeah
yeah
for grammar, if "being" is in the answer, its always wrong
its always it
"Appreciation" is an answer
like if
haha i love the little tricks
yeah thats such bs
you think so?
maths easy
grammars easy
i hate it
yeah
yeah i always finish with like 5 minutes
where like 24*2 = 36 or something
its always just like one goddamn stupid mistake
know anything
dont
i never like
haha i think i can easily get 800
i should take it
oh damn
i got a 740
haha dude physics was sick
well us codemonkeys suck at literature
so not you
haha literature
for me
not yet
physics?
did you take any SATIIs?
yeah
alright that's good
SAT teacher
not tutor
idk haha my tutor gave them to me
like at home
noo
then 2110
2030
yeah so far ive taken two tests
i want to get a 2400 but in reality i don't think ill top over 2200 :/
yeah its mostly just designed to trick idiots
i don't wanna deal with SAT's too much next year
haha
yeah
actually theres one other who might
haha
the only one
yep
and yeah i know
yeah im the only one in my grade though
im taking the SAT's early though
yeah not really
:D
haha its cuz most people my age are idiots
ahaha thanks man
lmao
two and a half
two more years in this hellhole
yep
haha
i'd offer to extend credit but i don't think that's the sort of thing you want credit for haha
legit i think im throwing that in a box with all my commonly used terms
#boss
creative exaggeration
haha
thats perfect
yes
haha its not lying its...
we all just hangout and talk and every now and then meet and work on a game
haha its so like unofficial though
that doesnt count i guess though
haha i started a Videogame Design club
haha for what?
and i guess the whole determination thing looks good on a college application
i go into season a piece of shit and then go out ripped
haha yeah thats the main one i dont like
i don't haha
yeah
its like 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 hours a day plus both days every weekend
like wrestling takes up so much fucking time
i feel like i should be doing more
haha thanks man
haha private school that stuff happens less
haha yeah i feel ya
haha it exacerbates all the bad things tho
yeah probably not
it actually bothers me ive never been to a party with alcohol
yeah that changes it all
yeah it is kinda all bullshit
yeah same actually :/
yeah thats a goodpoint
i think
best age
haha yeah man
today
yeah
hahaha yeah i know
ahh man i get my permit tomoro
salutations
aite
goddamn math sections are so easy
ima do a practice math SAT section
hey brb for 20
yeah and there also MIT
haha dude at MIT the kids were like worshipping you
i know how you feel though i had to teach gamemaker to my videogame design club
haha
oooh suckjs
oh was that the only thing that changed haha?
you switched up course though right?
yeah i can see how thatd happen
ugh thats a downer
yeah haha i heard it twice and i was like getting pissed
"Oh i teach a Microsoft Word course...but nobody ever comes"
then yeah i guess its up to chance
oh
yeah...guess which is gonna happen this year lol
like you'd love it
its like 12 x better than IDTech though
that's a good point haha
yeah man you gotta do it
oh yeah theres one in boston
Franklin and Marshall?
which one?
WHICH BTW YOU SHOULD TEACH AT
but thats because there were atleast a few normal people at CTY
and i just ended up with like a super awesome bunch of friends that everyone was jealous of
at CTY it was like that
haha well
*nerdy
and the least nerday
that'd make me the most normal
because since their all weird little nerds
that is part of the reason i sorta want to go
at the same time though
yeah every single MIT person is the same
like MIT
like its not all fucking scriptmonkeys
ahhaha dude Brown is like one of those schools that, from what i've heard, has really like well rounded spectrum of people
oo yeah i know that feeling
im starting to like brown
haha dude i remember my first mathematical proof that i did independent of the textbook...
im actually freaked now
comin from this guy
ahahaha
woah
ahahahahahaha
fuck i hate that
yeah im actually pumped for it
i havent even learned it yet
calculus is a brainfuck
really?
yeah haha same
yeah
and absolutely
induction = recursion
deduction = hardcoding
yeah haha
recursions easier to screw up though
yeah
my school doesnt have a single CS course
yeah really haha
but actually its one of those things thats really conceptual so its probably easier to teach to younger people
i think i learned that in sixth grade
idiots
haha woah i actually get that
i figured haha
yeah
although it doesnt really get at the expansional nature of it
hmm thats a clever way of thinking about it
mmhmm its like an infinite loop of death
gotta include a break-case
lol noobs
and you say fifteen javaw.exe
so you go into command prompt
yeah and they never hit the red button
yeah haha
he was like yeah with recursion... one mistake and your cpu crashes :/
he freaked me out
haha wolf tried to explain it to me he sucked
and yeha it really was
i freak them out with that anology
whenever my friends start to code
with her tattoo
xD
yeah haha
hahaha yeah
a snake eating itself
its like
haha yes it really is
and the node has to link
and all the info has to be wrapped in a node
if you know what i mean
but kinda time consuming
which is elegant
theres all this recursion
and with like a tree
since its all in a list
well i mean the reason its great is that there are no nodes involved
ahahaha sweet actually
im looking for a really fast index time
honestly for this
yess
and see four
and jump to one less than twice the respective element in the next array
then see five
then three
then two
one
because the iterator will check
[1, 2, 3, 5] [null, null, null, null, null, null, 4, null]
it becomes
but when you add one more
[1, 2, 3, 4,]
then
[1, 2, 3, null]
then
[1, 2, null, null]
then
[1, null, null, null)
first it would bee
in that order
1 2 3 4 5
lets sayy you're adding
so
ill get an examplee
hold on a sec
so that the iterator works
but it has to keep the ordering correct
yeah
it needs to reshift everything again
because once it reaches the limit
bah but it gets annoying
?
wouldnt you have to shift six seven eight nine and ten
if you insert one between five and six
lets say you have ten elements
well
Based on your explanation, it seems to me that performance would decrease at a rate faster than linearly as storage amount increases, which is fine based on the application - just something to note, assuming I read your description properly.
he said
thats odd.... my mentor seemed to think itd be exponential
don't believe so
yeah i was planning on keeping it always sorted
three becomes four
two becomes three
where element one becomes two
kinda like with a sorted arraylist :/
because if its not the maximum its gonna involve a lot of replacments
the insertion times gonna be a bitch
I'm using Java, and what I came up with an idea for a data structure that's somewhat like a Java Arraylist. It starts with an array of capacity four, and once the logical size reaches the capacity it creates a new array of size eight (and once that capacity is reached, it makes one with sixteen, then thirty two, etc.). Instead of de-allocating the first array and copying the nodes/objects into a second array, it links the second array of eight to the first array of four. However, it uses an algorithm to iterate through the Arraylist in a way similar to a Binary search tree. For instance, if there was 12 objects, the arrays would go like this [1, 4, 7, 10] - [11, 12, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9]. In searching for an object with key 'n', it starts at the first index of the first array and checks to see whether n is bigger or less than that key. If n is GREATER THAN the key, it jumps to the next index in the array or the first index of the next array, if you've reached the end of an array. If n is LESS THAN the key it jumps to one less than twice the index of the next array. For instance, if n is 8, then the iterator would start at 1, then jump to 4, then jump to 7, since 8 is greater then all numbers. It would then jump to 10, but since 8 is LESS THAN 10, the next number to check would be to the seventh index of the second array, since it is one less than twice the index of 10 in the first array (the index of 10 in the first array is fourth, so twice would be eighth, and one less than twice would be seventh). The seventh number in the second array is 8, so the program returns the object with key 8.
one sec
heres my synopsis as i explained it to my mentor
hahaha yeah
it does have a sorting algorithm
the data structure?
haha that mighta been me
with the binary iterator?
the dynamic arraylist linky thingy
haha yeah i told you about it
but i start my scifair tonight
lol i haven't done any coding in soooo long
*code
see how long you can go without a single line of coder
*finals
okay man good luck with finasl
haha i think my max is like 93ish
are you 100+ wpm?
and damn you typed that majorly fast
Okay sweet
its gonna be sIcK
Okay im pumped man
i should do more of that
i feel ya
did you ever do any sports?
yeah man
my brothers having those
oh yeah damn
lmao i have to get up at 5 to lift
is fucking nuts
dude my wrestling team
im running on like four hours
i gotta get some sleep
yo mate i gotta run
they piss me the fuck off
there's like the racist clique
we have some of those in our school
Lmao yeah i hate that
GA kids are majorly smart though
yeah im not getting that haha
top of class right?
yeah she was a pretty terrible girl
lmao my best friends ex went there
actually that might be upper perk
you guys have a pretty good wrestling team i think
ahh
lmao Upper Perk right?
the Center for Talented Youth thing
ahaha thanx mate im surprised you've never done CTY
always end up in the same places
the smart normal people
dude im tellin ya
ahahaha damn
that'd be like mindblowing
we ran into each other there
dude imagine if
oh damn haha
you are a big fucking deal haha
really? damn man
yeah i missed the submission thing though ;/
is it only for sophomores?
really? damn
i was gonna do that
and yo did you go to HOBY?
damn dude thats nice
#fuckIdTech
campuses
that sounds sick i hate all those boring-ass little middle-of-nowhere
FUCK YEAH
sweet i hate the F&M campus
is it more urban like MIT or country-ish like F&M
yeah dude im def applying
just tiny haha
yeah man rhode island is chill
lmfao
okay sweet all my asshole friends didn't come to the MIT one ill make them come to this one
if you need help with anything lemme know too
DUDE HOLY SHIZMONGERS post me info im def coming
woah really?!
should i set up a minecraft server
fucking trust an amphibious mammal selling MDMA
but seriously never ever
surprise bitch
o.0.o
yeah that's weird
that too
oh
duck billed platapuses selling MDMA
seriously though isn't that like freaky?
no about 80 years older
in the same suit
and i saw the same two guys
which is like half an hour away
and then today i was walking into the lansdale library
years old-ish
they looked like 18-25
all dressed in nice-ass suits
two or three guys came into subway
subway actually
yesterday at wawa
so dude
alright
lolwtf?
how???
haha wanna play now?
like 192.168 and so one or whatever
shouldn't the gateway be the default?
lmao
whats the internet provider?
ahaha bringing relaxation to new levels
yo watsup man
haha yeah man and we can always hang during the summers
and yeah dude you're like my best friend i won't ditch you
and i mean you leave for college after a year anyway
that shit ain't gonna happen
don't worry dude
hell idk if i'll even get in with the missed deadline and stuff
this is probably the hardest decision i've ever had to make
damn dude
and i mean i obviously don't fit in at GA
so i might go there and hate the kids there as much as i hate the ones at GA
maybe it's not GA maybe it's just me dude
and besides
and it's pointless if i abandon my old ones
and to meet new friends
but I mean the reason i'd be leaving GA is because I don't like the people
ahh man that's super depressing
so we wouldn't hang out as much
it is a boarding school though :/
but i honestly just hate GA
yeah it's not significantly better than GA
whatcha think?
i applied and stuff and they loved my grades and credentials
but they're really interested in me
i missed the deadline
haha depends on whether or not i get in
i might go there next year
getting interviewed by the Hill School
guess what i'm doing tomorrow
anyway
definitely not skittles you know what a tattlewhore she is
not even nobody
*
conscience
or your subconcience
not even yourself
like anybody in the world
like seriously anyone
yo don't tell anyone this
haha nor can i man
ALRIGHT
GL
thanks haha
haha alright man
haha private schools arent required to
none i don't think
haha
nope
idk if you count PSAT and ACT
and SAT's duh
PSAT's ACT's and AMC
we do
how the media portrays aliens as bug eyed monsters, but the scientific community disagrees and one guy came up with this paradox that disproved aliens"
yeah basically the passage was about
thats it
then "Science = quick...completely WRONG"
"Paradox, explains why it is impossible"
next paragraph
second half second paragraph: "Guy questions"
first half second paragraph: "Science is right, guy disagrees"
first paragraph: "Media overestimates aliens"
so pretty short
and its 43 lines and four paragraphs
and this is just the comments i did from the first
you compared two passages
on this particular one
alright ill read you all the coments from one
usually its just a phrase that captures the main idea of the passage
here ill give you some exceprts from it
that was the only practice test i didn't do at 3 in the morning or on the ride to the place
look at the reading sections in that one they're pretty good i think
one of my practice SAT's i got a 2200 on
for reading
haha
the better you do
the more writing you have in the margin
let me tell you
yeah
math is the only one that requires actual thinking
and get a near perfect on the reading and writing
a RETARD
you can be
dude
it's learning
there you go
e) Antipteradactlyspherical
d) Hardcore
c) Appreciation
b) Nostalgia
a) Indifference
"How does the author feel about (insert some specific type of art, ie. roman arquitecture, african american literature, navajo sandpaintings)?"
haha you'll see this question on every single passage
it's always right
"Appreciation" is an answer
and if
oh
luck*
that's really just look
don't worry about math
yeah i got two wrong
i'd probably be chilling with arjun and chris but you can get in of you want
haha you can come if you want
haha Mr GA's tomorrow
you won't benefit from it
and btw skip the math section
yeah man
haha no problem man
i like wrote out all the answers
it's got all the lessons
you can have my review book
yeah i won't be taking another for a while
cuz they overthink it
and those are the ones that get the smart people
all the big picture ideas will be easy as shit
^^ if you just remind yourself what that is
"what is the main idea of the passage"
honestly the only one that i worried about was
that's what my teacher recommended
and either "what conclusion does the author reach?" or "How did this experience impact the author's life?"
"Whats the authors POV"
"Whats the overall main idea/what is it about"
i said it kinda badly
alright ill read you the exact rule he gave
hold on ill get you an example
and if you can get those three questions the multiple choice questions seem easier
actually by the second one i really mean "what's the main idea"
"What is the Mood"
"Why are they writing it"
"Who is the reader"
and ask three questions
underline shit
even if they sound right
that it is not C D or E
but you know for SURE
i didn't really think it through
A or B
and yeah it could be a or b
but its the BEST WAY
yeah that was a bad example
c d and e
you can rule out
e) thinks of being a user of
d) enjoys being involved with
c) is being supportive of
b) supports
a) is a firm believer in
Jake _is a firm believer in_ herbal medicines and remedies
Give the most correct version of the following sentence.
example
it's not that answer choice
if "being" is in an answer choice
i honestly have no idea how it's allowed
you can download apps for it
it has a word processor on it
tell me when you're taking it
i'll let you use it
yeah cuts out a lot of time
oh and my instructor gave them to me
and it instantly gives a solution
solve(20x^3 + 3^x=30x + .05x^2, x)
and you just type in
alright i have a calculator
and its allowed haha
which can solve any algebra problem
and i'm going to lend you my calculator
that brought up my score 100 points
haha
"being" is always wrong
just remember
i'm sure you can do it man
and i talked to him when i was at graduation
you've probably met him
he used to be like my brother's best friend
yeah i have a friend who went to soudy and goes there now i can hook you up if you need help getting in
you just need better connections with this stuff
haha thanks man i'm proud to be yo friend but man you're just as smart as me
lmao you crack me up man

Like I would love to know you better, but the thing is I'd be the only Sophomore going, and I don't really know any juniors. If I had a lot of friends going or I knew you super well it would probably be different... I'm really sorry but I don't think it would be a good idea to go. Plus I'm like super super awkward at parties where I don't know anybody. This is like totally not an issue with you it's an issue with me..."

she was trying to get me to hook up w/ her and i was like nat...your desperate... i'm sorry but its true :(
she freaked out last night
driving me insane
^^^^ this girl
I know you said we shouldn't talk, and I promise you, this is a one time thing. But I was thinking today, and I don't think I can't deal with not being allowed to talk to a friend. It's not a friendship. Its just...awkward eye contact in the hall. Our friendship has been a long and funny thing, but I honestly can't deal with feeling so insecure in one friendship. We're very different people, and that's fine. But I don't think that friendship is… See All And this makes me sad because you'll agree, but it's just better I'm sorry
dude look what nat just sent me
yeah -.-
haha it means like all knowing right

I mean, at the end of the day, we're at GA to get a good education
but it's useless just making a statement
I agree with everything you said
pretty much :/
haha why do i doubt that my idea would be chosen if i said that
killed it
thanks dude
haha true that
just 3. Do you believe having some casual fridays would make GA feel more like a home?
okay haha. tbh probably not going to use anything for my presentation
2. What are your opinions on having "themed casual Fridays?" Examples could include "Ugly sweater day" or "break the dress code day"
ok ok ok haha
quick response - go
1. What do you think of GA's current dress code? Does it contribute to any stress?
this is for Challenge GA
do me a fav?

what exactly is bio hw
np
yeah
go to the site

󾓝
yeah sounds safe
and like it lacks genetic information
so i basically said it makes it smaller, gives it less nutrients, and makes it carry O2
means less nutrients
and less cytoplasm
well hemoglobin carries O2
i BSed it
no and yes
is all dat info in the book?

Hey there
Okay I must shower! Can we talk this weekend?
He's the president?? Awesome haha
Yep!
Yeah haha. I'll be graduated unfortunately. How's Adrian?
They're already planning the next exchange haha
Hmmm, life here in America is nice :D we talked about you guys today with mr masters
Ahh prom! Prom is awesome
School? I'm sorry :(
Damn that long? Haha it's all great. How's Sylwia?
BYE :D
hey I must go, but we should talk more
:( okay
like you could probably get a free ride
well you should apply! all US colleges want foreign students and most will pay ANYTHING to get one
or go to college here?
hmm do you ever think you'll live here?
aw. well when you find one let me know
noo :(
psh when are you coming to America. It's boring here
ahaha you're not lazy
that's good! me too, but I have a lot of work to do
haha good :D life here is boring... nothing to do. what about you?
I missed my Polish friend
I know D:
hey i just learned James Bond theme on piano and it made me think of when your choir sang it years ago
I doo haha ;)
Haha thanks ;) she's polish you know, and always asks about my polish friends haha
okay haha goodnight <3
haha wow I miss you
haha
and GO TO SLEEP
talk to ya later <3 <3 <3
hey I have to go eat dinner
haha that's true
oh well haha :(
we still can't hang out D:
haha but then we have the same problem right?
like, more in Poland than in the US
haha I would probably have more friends :D if I moved there now
oo how is Adrian?
maybe I'll live in Poland one day haha
me too D:
and I'm glad I met you! I just wish we could have spent more time together... you guys left so quickly
hmm, well maybe there's no difference between Americans and Poles... maybe we both have good and bad people?
ahahaha <3 <3
but you guys are all so grateful!
haha sorry I must seem like a dick...
me neither!
he'll say he likes someone when in front of them, and then make fun of them behind their backs
he's twofaced
he is an asshole
haha you can say the same about the Polish! which of my friends did you like?
and I think I like more Polish people than I do Americans
you got lucky :D
but you stayed with the nicest people in America! if you visit every corner of the world, you will never meet anyone as nice as the Hearns
and amazing
we're so mean and spoiled :( and you guys are so nice
Polish are nicer than any Americans
i know, me too
it's weird though, I have this feeling like I will definitely see you again
i know it's so weird :(
haha of course of course
haha i'll have to give you a review
well jump on a plane and visit me damnit
I already went to the gym and bought a present for my dad
then probably work some more
then go out with my family to see the new Superman movie
eat dinner with my family
hmm work on a school project for next year
so that's really late in poland right?
5:40 PM
i know
you'll make it
haha that's true
aww haha i'm sorry
:(
that sucks girl
you are still in school?
haha no i have plenty of time to relax, that's what i'm doing now haha
my summer is so busy Sylwia
working a lot
hmm well I'll be hanging out with friends
aww well go hang out with some friends or something
?
what are you up to
haha summer's pretty nice ;)
how's Poland?
hiii!
Sylwia
thanks :D you too
hasta luego
<3 <3 <3 <3
okay i will talk to you soon
rough night
haha yeah :( 4 hours of sleep
passionately
like i hate finals
Sylwia
it's horrible Sylqia
D:
i worked from 12:00 to 2:30
yesterday
i know :(
i must go
agh
haha i hope so :) thanks Sylwia
so it's all studying here :(
haha our finals start in two days
i'm so sorry haha
wow that actually really sucks
haha its cool i thought so
haha best part of my day
❤
And the first thing he says is, "this Polish Girl, Sylwia, was talking about you" ahahaha
I walk into school, and I saw Mr Masters
So this morning
!!!
HEY GUESS WHAT
go study <3 and until next time
haha okay thank you my dear
haha me neither
and when the summer comes we can talk all the time
we'll talk soon i promise
okay i have to go now
weekends haha <3
i know i know
okay i'll try to message you earlier
hrmm that's when i get home
i'm in school then :/
what time is that?
haha you're just never on so i send when you're offline
i write all the time!!
ahaha
we'll talk soon
okay you must go study
haha okay I'll be there in an hour
haha when should I?
haha you need to! dang if we went to the same college that'd be awesome
well he loves the US haha
and he says it was the best decision he ever made
and your english is a lot better than his
came from Turkey to study
my brother's best friend in college
it's actually fine
haha perfect
that's true too
you should though, Americans love Polish
i know :/
you should definitely apply
so you don't have to pay anything at all
and if your family makes less than 60,000$/year they pay for everything
your chance at getting in is waaaay larger
so if you're from a smaller country like Finland or Poland
are required to have a certain number of students from every country
like Harvard, Yale, etc.
actually the best colleges
if we went to the same school :D
omg that would be amazing haha
anyway, you should come to the US for college
hehe ^ bad timing there
haha well maybe i can't do it then
Maybe we'll end up working together one day
Haha computer scientist :) very boring
And ooo me too, only I'm more physics
My brother does bioengineering! He loves it
Haha it's cool. Do you plan on studying biology as a job? Like do you want to be a doctor?
do you plan on needing biology later?
haha aw that's good
haha i don't want you to do badly in biology!
now go study woman
haha okay sounds good
?
haha why's that
be asleep by 10:00?
tonight?
maybe we should both try going to bed earlier haha?
haha that's okay i do it too
why not haha?
haha it's very unhealthy
most nights i don't start my homework until like 8
wow that's very early haha
haha i will :D
i know :( the average per night in my school is 5-6 hours
!
you should ask to do something like that
haha Bottom of the River was sooooo much fun
so we did songs like "Bohemian Rhapsody" and "Ziggy Stardust" and "Somebody to Love"
hahaha no it was fine i got you. I'm glad it was fun! all we got to do was a performance with songs from Queen and David Bowie
haha i don't sleep enough :( but HOW DID THE CONCERT GOOOO????
oops wrong person hehe
why?
haha i hope so :D how have you been? I haven't been able to talk to recently. our sleep schedules don't exactly work well

haha i can't wait girl
Oh you definitely should, you're always welcome to visit
Haha grrr I wish you lived in America
Haha well my mom tries to not embarrass me... Thankfully
Haha "she's very pretty, I like her" more or less
Haha me too I guess... Ahhhh so my mom was working at the dance... And she saw me talking to you hahaha
Don't tell him I told you that haha... He only said it because he knew I liked you too
Haha yes very true :) but I have to admit Adrian hinted that you liked me... I was like YES haha
So it's true for me too
Aww that might be the nicest thing I've heard... <3 before we met I told one of my friends that I thought you were really pretty
Ahahaha I love this girl

Oh, did you like the Hearns?
Haha good good, and aww thanks ;)

Haha Poland isn't that bad! Maybe I just like Polish people
Haha why is it weird?
If other Poles are as nice as you two, I want to live in Poland
Ahhh haha... Well I really only met you and Adrian, but you're both two of the nicest people I've ever met
It is beautiful... The US is too crowded
I knoooow... Well how is Poland?

Haha I guess, can't wait
I know!! Haha I wish we could have hung out
Yeah it was awful :(
Haha and they also gave us a ton of homework so we didnt have any time

Oh wow, but you're on American time haha.
What time is it??
Oh hey you should stop by and visit!!
Haha what's that?

hey jaqui
alright man
and i'm really sorry haha
alright man good luck bro
you don't want any help with your other option girl?
and if you need any connections or anything
i feel like a dick, so if you want me to do any undercover spec-ops shit i'm your man
no prob man, honestly i'll do anything to help you out
what about Carolyn Yang?
haha don't worry about it man
haha well
well, honestly, i guess it's your choice
but one of her friends is mediating a thing between us
well i guess i did not ask her...
haha were you thinking of asking her?
Haha funny you should mention that bro
np man
nope i dont think so
yeah
that one
"It would be incorrect..."
h/o lemme check
it's a speech by stalin
I wish we hadn't handed in our summary
Florian's really pushing us
like wow
yo, also btw there is a ton of shit on this test haha
it was equally as bad as I was expecting :(
meh
and we have to write a summary too
yeah it's basically list every character and say something about him/her
alright gnite all
I'm totally down with wearing fox ears
eh let's just decide tomorrow haha
haha
I'm a horrible actor but I'll take one for the team if need be
does anyone want to be Angsthase?
So we're good to print out the script right?
Okay, let's do them tomorrow then
also I realized I never handed in my project proposal today - did he collect them?
oh okay, can we work on them in class tomorrow you think?
wait are they due tomorrow?
nooo like the paper sheets he handed out
alright so we good? time to do the damn worksheets?
haha yessss
awesome haha
yessss
forreal?
oh haha it's totally fine if you don't
strategically*
wait Lucy if you have cat ears we could strategially take them on and off
also for the Uncle, could we do the same person who plays fox??
haha freaky
or two tabs?
is yours open in two browsers?
wait wtf yeah
oh noes :(
Yeah let's try to do that
also are we going to have the opportunity to rehearse this?
caffeine tho
haha sorry
DAMNIT KEIKO
Solid - we done?
Haha are you guys fine with like a tug of war between the bunny and the fox? They both pull Ulli?
stage directions in english or german?
Keiko, I'll end with when the fox runs away?
think - the fight scene is mostly stage directions, and the awards-giving is like just the narrator saying what's happening
nope! haha none of them are
Okay I'll take over from there actually, so you're good!
so wait Lucy, where should I start?
no sweat haha, I hadn't started yet
Oh I thought I was - no worries, I'll do the fight scence
so section 2 starts with "...but Ulli wasn't fast enough"
hmmm I guess the end of section 1 is when the fox comes, and Ulli and die Angsthase run away?
0.0
hmm could go either way? that'd just be super psychadelic
maybe like, die Angsthase grabs das Fuchs by the sweatshirt or something? idk
instead of like grabbing by the tail
alright yeah for the fight...
ahh gotcha gotcha
Lucy is your propic from Toads??
haha perfect, Florian will like that
sounds sehr gut
since you already did some of it
the first part is probs shortest, so maybe Lucy you take that one?
ja?
and Die Angsthase kicking the fox's ass?
the fox attacking Ulli
wait yeah that's a good idea too, breaking it up by section
ok cool
or collaborate - I'm totally down with whatev
okay want me to take over for like 15 then?
we could also just switch off if yours is being buggy
alright sweet, Keiko is docs working for you?
Ah okay I started a chat too but let's use this one
haha aight cyaaa
hmm i'ma go watch Mad Men
wow holy fuq i'm tired

mannequins

adfasdfa
but they're soooo good damnit
entirely repulsing
old movies
i find most like

haha yeah
and some of the creepy episodes are creepier than anything today
and i think that most of the stories are better than anything today
59-64, sorry
it's in black and white
was made from 1960-64
the twilight zone
this show
so anyway
<3
hehehehe
haha you're very laughy...

i was thinking ist for it
yeah
eff
isn't that we?
es...

vi gets
hiii
but he's like obsessed with cars and alcohol and is always talking about them
normally yeah
grr that bitch
like what the hell dude
"Oh if you had passed your permit test in the first place this wouldn't be an issue"
after we're like talking about how mom has to drive me
and eventually he's like
and so i'm like well i have wrestling tomorrow
and he's like why
and i'm like no i'm not getting drunk
and he wanted me to get drunk with him
wow my brother's like really drunk
haha i don't get much sleep
*tired damnit
*tire
soo tire
brb
baaaaam
haha wow that was actually pretty deep
i wish art didn't hate me

damn did you do that by hand?
bittee
whatcha sending meeeee
then you should see the little paperclip jawn
go to like messages at the top left
yeaaah
and actually Jason does most of my texturing when I need that sort of thing
haha I use Paint.net for any texturing I do
i know f*** pixel editing
i never tried Illustrator or anything
although i used to be a boss with photoshop haha
haha graphic design!
yeah haha the punctuation gets me
and if it were just words i could probably do that
i have a teacher that can do like 120
and yeah
86 or 85
yeahhh haha
and the first time i took one that's actually exactly what i got...
yeah haha
haha the Tigers one has a bunch of greek words and capitals and punctuation and indenting and stuff which is hard to do quickly
and the Aesop's fable is like in the middle
the "Typing Instructions" one is the easiest and the "Tigers in the Wild" or whatever one is the hardest haha
i'm using a different site though, because I know all them by heart haha
haha i just retried and got 99
what'd you get
so i'm slow today...
and got 95
haha well i just took one now

well i'm glad you accept me ;)
again, unhealthy habits here
i think that's part of why i wrestle
i hate that haha
just not for being smart, or nerdy
or something like that
funny, or witty
i'm okay being known for being like
like
all the wannabe hackers at my school come to me for advice :(
haha it shouldn't though!
haha :' (
so they made me figure out a way to send it haha...
and it was too big to send in an email
but it was like 75 MB or something
they needed to email this video
and on our wrestling team
: ( i should go die haha
THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS JAMES BOND
and that annoying little inner voice kept pointing out all the discrepancies in what they were saying haha
they were talking about like hacking and encryption and such
haha so in the new James Bond movie

Chris Tsinontides

thanks love
haha yeah i guess
haha i try love
haha i think i have social anxiety
i wish i could be drunk-ish without being drunk at all
i know :(
but with that little alcohol thing i sorta become like the most outgoing one there
like at a party i won't talk
but i mean it's super dramatic with me
and i know this is like a realllllllly bad thing but when alcohol is involved i lose all my shyness haha
i'm soooooo introverted and withdrawn
but like normally
haha well normally i'd be really shy then, but i feel really relaxed around Soudy people, plus Kaylie is like mah sister
i hate it haha i wish i wasn't
i'm actually like reaaaaaally shy
0.0 oh my haha yeah i'm the same

oh that's awesome... why don't you like the people though?
Ahh sounds awesome...do you like Souderton?
Thanks :D I'll let you know next time I go to one
Yeah haha you guys are all so nice
I think I will actually...Jason usually just kinda ditches me at them
I actually like hanging with Souderton people more than Germantown Academy people
Sweet :D i've been to like two Soudy ones before but yeah that was the best
so what did you think of the football game?
Yeah same i think i was like eight
:D I've been there
Haha I get to see my brother alllll the time
which is like...an hour away...
oh sweet mine's at Lehigh
wait where does your brother go?
Like wow...
really haha? dude this is crazy
do you know if he ever came over to my house?
Oh really? Haha this is nuts
Ahaha daaaang i wanna see what Kaylie says to this
Yeah :D like one of those weird small world moments where you know someone who knows someone who knows someone else who knows your brother...
this is like...blowing my mind...
Woahhhhhh haha that's crazy
wait haha really??
Wait really? What's your bro's name?
Oh
You can name whatever you want, Matt :D
Matt though...
Thanks Kerr, and you definitely deserve it too!
Idk why it just sent you a map either
Oh shit dude I was watching the new Star Trek. Good ass movie haha
But you like your school better?
But I wasn't really sure if it was any better
I was gonna go to hill school
Haha dude came sooo close to leaving
Eh I'm not so sure about that, it's really not that much of a leg up
GA is also a lifesucking hellhole man
Do you like it??
Yeah solid plan. Dude once you figure out all the college stuff senior year is amazing
Haha I'm just kidding I'm staying all four years. And yeah it's def worth it though
Yeah man, as long as they'll keep me. College sports are some crazy shit
Oh sweet dude, are you gonna bball?
Haha yeah I love it man, college is like 100x better than hs
Yale University at the moment haha. Any thoughts yourself?
It's over soon man
Maaan college is 12x easier than senior year
I'm great man how are you?
alright dude peace out
yeah hahaha how freakin weird
as in soon
like soon
yeah dude we gotta hangout
alright man you i gotta go to bed i'm teaching in like a few hours
i can see it now
lmfao
the entire race
haha just run backwards
haha go to CHA maybe we'll end up racing off in track
yeah good choice hah
haha i'm thinking of pennsbury or something
oh awkward
they board right?
woah man Pennridge is right by my house i think
?
prep or public
what schools you lookin at?
haha good luck bro
when you get your permit?
parents have to do partially with that
haha i can get my license i just haven't yet
man we'll still hangout
alright man dude i'm gonna miss you
you got me and pat
yeah man but you got friends
dude no way why?
whaaaat?
yeah man whatsup
we gotta hang man
haha r u?
haha not yet man
haha yeah fuck school
haha sweet you?
yoo dude wasup
brb actually
i thought of a get-rich scheme for us
guys
plus, i felt her balls one time
haha she already told kerry she'd say yes to me
you just don't remember it...
honestly, i've felt your balls too
like looks wise
i also think Sarah is really attractive
she has a better but than you
it's not
her butt is really big
haha kev
friday
haha sarah
Yeah wow that's incredible. 200,000 dollars?? I'm reading that right?
Something like that
Hmm
Okay it has Google Calendar support but not sure to what extent
Okay I'll have to check.
Oh ok, thanks Leen. And to be honest I'm not entirely sure what you mean Ruchit. So you want to be able to edit it via iCal? So like on your phone?
Rct?
I'm in Berlin now, will get to it ASAP but haven't been able to find an outlet adapter for my laptop
^ratchet Hindi
Tikke Bhai
Praneeth: Ruchit is demo-ing the calendar tomorrow, and needs the production server up to date. Can you push the most recent changes? Main thing is the JQuery bug
psadda
Can I get that into excel?
Wait what? It'll print it in ASCII formatting?
Okay. I can save that to my local machine?
From rails console? How do I export to csv?
And/or give Tyler a tutorial how to do so
All the changes are being done on the live page, I don't think there's a backup
Yeah I opened a PR
I can definitely handle it but I'm packing, and have to leave at noon for my flight tomorrow. Probably won't be able to work on it till I'm all set in India.
you shouldn't have to register
https://rabb.it/Ty.Petrochko?i=-nWPJFO2E
try this
actually hold on
Did you get it?
Yeah, I just sent you one
Yeah, still not showing. Ruchit, did you get my request?
hmm, not showing up for me, I'll restart skype
Oh, hold on
I added you. was it the wrong one?
tyler.petrochko
cool, I'm ready whenever you guys are
Great, I think for multiple persons we can only do voice right?
Okay so should we skype so I can fill in you Ruchit on what Ruchit had and so Shahnawaz can give me the features so I can fill in Praneeth?
Good luck bud
Yeah absolutely
there are two Ruchit.nagar
also Ruchit are you Houston Ruchit or India Ruchit? I'm assuming Houston?
Yeah he had to go, but I can fill you in
He said I could fill him in on a features list from Shahnawaz
Yeah, sorry Praneeth and I were talking
Okay, sounds good
Ok, sounds good. Praneeth, let me know if we should talk in the meantime
Yeah that would work if it's just us two. Mohammed, are you joining too?
Hey Praneeth, what skype are we using?
Yeah we are calling then, right?
Nevermind actually
Oh okay. You guys could always do that at 11 tonight, right? Since I'll get all that from Praneeth when we meet?
^That also works
Could we maybe do two meetings? It seems like Praneeth and I have no problem meeting tomorrow or Monday, and I can talk to you before six today or early tomorrow
Ok, sounds good
Will Abhi be traveling then?
works for me
Sweet, when are you free Monday, Praneeth?
I also might be able to step out at some point and voice call in, if that would work
This is my bad - I didn't think we'd be meeting tonight so I already agreed, and we'll probably be out from 6 on
Ok, I am supposed to be picking up a friend, is there any way I can talk with you now, and then Praneeth tomorrow/Monday? Tomorrow I'm traveling the second half of the day
I just learned I might be picking up a friend who's staying in NH tonight, I'm talking to him now
Praneeth emailed us about meeting today actually, I'm by sterling now

i remember that
ohhh
i forget all that crap
functions wave?
fuck you you're wrong
don't you fuckin dare
invite Max Det
what outline?
i have no idea haha
kevin you don't have to know that
i don't know what that is
but its usually in reference to the gas
actually reverse that
effusion = when it spreads through the room
diffusion = when you fart
amphoteric substances are when you have Hydrogen bonded to specific metal hydroxides or when you have the conjugate base of a polyprotic acid
anvit be mah BITCH
foooooool
HSO4 IS
!!!!!!
H2SO4 is NOT AMPHOTERIC
HES NOT
NO
^ in any other conversation what would that be like
on a dolphin...
with an infection
it could be an oversized clitoris
no i'm with kevin
sounds very abrasive
i know right?
they rub their dicks in the sand
jk
with their flippers
yep
dolphins and primates
also they're one of two types of animals that masturbate

nahh lewis are totally different
i wouldn't worry with learning how to tell them
yeah
Lewis Base gives an electron pair
to form a covalent bond
Lewis Acid accepts an electron pair
haha Kevin now i have to learn it
continue
sorry
AHAHAHAHA
FUCK YOU
Lews, Arhhenis, or Bronsted
or should like the two most electronegative ones have -1
should the most electronegative one have -2?
with a net charge of -2
if you have like an ion
but what i don't get is
i'm a fucking cake
senor
si
CH3COO
i mean
NO3 and CH3OOH
or like my three rat terriers tearing apart the bunny that used to live in my garden :(
yep
and hydration complexes right?
like X x 5H20
are you talking about hydration complexes?
yeah and the d orbitals can split into two sublevels for transition elements
O3 is ozone right?
okay
NO2
or is that O3
NO2 is like brown right
Cl2 is yellow
Matt what are all the colored molecules/atoms we have to know
it definitely won't be super important
he definitely could have explained that better
yeah see
like
he only gives examples
yeah but he never explains it
ahahahah
do i want to
yeah i have no idea
sp3d2
sp3d
sp3
sp2
sp
goes
the hybrid orbitals, going in ascending order in regards to the total number of bonds and lone pairs
zeke
thank you
good
okay
oh
your welcome?
for hybrid orbitals
so
alright
you get the whole d orbital thing right...
then sp3d
then sp3
sorry
sp2
its sp3
if its 3
its sp
so if your number is 2
because you have one bond and one lone pair
thats two
if you have a triple and one lone pair
your number is 4
so if you had two lone pairs, and two single bonds
you count up the total number of lone pairs and ADD it to the number of bonds
i mean a single, double, OR triple bond
and by a bond
is going to have some combination of bonds and lone pairs
any molecule that's bonded
okay zeke
i got this
alright matt step down
no
no
lmao
it's impossible to have two sigma bonds in one bond
yeah
i'm going to sum this up
but we're all on different pages
i get what everyone's saying
yeah yeah yeah
just listen for like 1 sec
alright i got this
yeah it's totally not
no not at all
that has three sigma
NH3
there can be more than one sigma bond...
hmm
i mean it's impossible to have only one lone pair and no shared pairs
it is thoroughly impossible to just have one lone pair
i miss being the most prepared one here...
they're used interchangeably
pi bond = atomic bond
by the way
sigma bond = hybrid bond
any bond has one sigma bond in it
the little blonde was hot
good luck with that mate
yeahhh she was
ohhh the big momma
unless you're talking about the realllllly big one
pretty sure there wasn't a girl with a belly button ring there...
the brunette?
yo zeke i saw you talkin to that girl at Natalie's
alright i'll save it for next time
damnit
i was so prepared that time too
oh wow
i know what i heard
so you count the total number of sigma bonds then add it to the number of free electron pairs and that's how many sub orbitals will be in your hybrid orbital so lets say you have three single bonds and a lone pair you would be sp3 hybridized
zeke did you hear my spheal on hybridization
i have no idea haha
yeah
gl man
ahahaha
83 if i want an A
i need a 68
you probably will
shh
yes ma'am
no that's fine...
i was close
btw its 1.7 not 2.7
lemme check that second number
>2.7 = ionic
.3-2.7 = polar covalent
.1-.3 = Nonpolar covalent
are considered covalently bonded
which are bonded by triple bonds
N2
so like
well a covalent bond is just the relationship between two molecules with a difference in electronegativity smaller than .3
a sigma bond is formed by a pair of shared electrons between two molecules
and a triple has two
but it just means that a double bond has one pi bond
truthfully i have no idea what that means
pi bonds are formed by parallel atomic orbitals
zeke knows chemistry?
Ahh okay I get what you mean now.
Wait why do we need a binary column?
In my head, I kinda knew that was the solution but just thought there was a cheap workaround hahaa
But we want it to schedule for March, NOT April, which will essentially be a forgotten month
When we look for the first month with no camp events, it's going to find April
(not out of the question, I think)
and the very last camp of February gets rescheduled for March 1st
We've scheduled events through January and February
I thought of that too. Weird case though, what about this
sorry continue
ah ok.
That also avoids the error where, when you change the day_of_the_month variable on a camp, you don't have to look for 3 months worth of future camps
Okay, I agree. So only reschedule camp events for next month.
Rather than check every day between today and today + 3.months?
so it does all camps in THIS month, all camps in this month + 1 month, etc.?
so we're relying on the fact that we only ever run that task once per month?
But what if we accidentally run that task twice?
Wait, so ignore that case?
what conditions does it check?
What about the first time you run it, though?
How do we know which months have already been handled, though?
or B) Find some clever way to make sure that we aren't replacing "moved but NOT rescheduled" camp events
we can either A) Restrict editing to rescheduled camp events
But do you know what I mean with that issue?
and ok
should I restrict editing the date to rescheduled camp events?
the issue with that is that when someone manually edits the date of a camp event, running the task will replace it where it "should be"
if it already exists, the uniqueness validation will fail
try to create a camp event on THAT day of the month
for all camps that have day_of_the_month n
for each day between today and three months from today {
so, the pseudocode for the scheduling task is this
nah that worked
/how do I run all delayed jobs
Oh - can I not test locally?
A) It says it was run at 2:22, which totally makes zero sense
Job id: 9, priority: 0, attempts: 0, handler: "--- !ruby/object:ActiveJob::QueueAdapters::Delayed...", last_error: nil, run_at: "2015-06-24 14:22:57", locked_at: nil, failed_at: nil, locked_by: nil, queue: "default", created_at: "2015-06-24 14:22:57", updated_at: "2015-06-24 14:22:57"
Do you have any idea why my Jobs are enqueuing but not running?
Okay, that sounds good.
okay, will do
Should we refractor it, so it's like tasks:schedule
Awesome, thanks.
Ok sweet
Haven't actually tried it yet
running 'rake calls:schedule' will set into motion all the calling scheduling stuff?
Also, am I correct in saying that:
Okay, I see where you're coming from.
Are you sure constants an an array are the way to go, though? As opposed to an enum?
Ah ok, I'll check that out
/will anything break if I go back to using an enum?
So created camp events are 'canceled' by default now
It also broke the Jquery on the calendar that calculates number of cancellations out of total
When you say CampEvent.status in rails console, it now returns an integer, rather than 'active' 'canceled' or 'rescheduled'
Praneeth, why aren't we using enums for CampEvent status anymore?
The big issue is that I'm gone from June 28 to July 18
With regard to the android stuff, I have mostly Java/JavaFX experience, so I'd probably be able to pick stuff up pretty fast
Abhi and I are out until Tuesday
Hey Praneeth
Ok, some tests are failing so I'm fixing them at the moment.
is what I have now
# Modules config.autoload_paths << Rails.root.join('lib')
Should I do the specific file or the whole lib?
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3356742/best-way-to-load-module-class-from-lib-folder-in-rails-3?lq=1 second answer
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3945124/how-can-i-use-mixins-or-modules-in-my-controllers-in-rails-3
Don't think so, I'll link you the SO
Seems like the rails way to do it but it almost feels unnecessary
Question: is autoloading lib files from application.rb a bad idea?
jk you can autoload
Wait - update, so If I move the data origin module to /lib then won't I have to require it in every single model that we use it in?
I get they all might have data_origin now, but just in case we have to add any more?
Also holdup, when you set the data_origin in the api base controller, shouldn't you check if the given attribute has a data_origin field?
I need to figure out how to route it so that it can be in lib
Actually, right now I have data_origin_validations sitting in app/models
In that case I'll be done with it in five
Ah, ok.
Isn't setting a default value basically that?
Also I don't really see how I can set the data_origin for console
On Heroku? Is there any way that I could totally screw up everything?
Second thing - when we push the track_data_origin branch to production, what happens to all our previous data? Like, how do we decide what data origin to assign it
I saw there was a feature for that on heroku but wasn't sure if we are using it
First, are we backing up our production db anywhere?
Hey Praneeth, two questions
Ok I'm gonna do that now
0.0
If so that's pretty badass
Or did you just put it into the console?
just wondering
also do you have the code you used to get that query onhand?
Also Ruchit confused me, he was talking about a different excel sheet
Sure.
Ruchit says it's a code red in terms of necessity haha
Hey Praneeth, did you manage to figure it out?
despite the fact that it was iterating over an array 500 entries long
and it still only got 200 of the 500 entries
and just adding blank entries for every vaccine for every patient
Because I tried commenting out all the vaccine stuff
But making that fix alone shouldn't fix it
Yeah, I'm about to go to bed so I'll do the SQL module tomorrow
Ah, makes sense.
Yeah, that's why I'm gonna go through the SQL thing tomorrow
Actually I think it should be Array.any?
Yep, I meant Array.includes?, my bad
the array method 'include?' like p.vaccinations.include?(v)
so include?
include?
replace it with what?
kk
Maybe this is a good time for StackOverflow haha...
Another possibility is that it's running out of RAM? That doesn't seem likely, although it does take quite a while to run (with includes, about 30 seconds, with joins, seemingly forever)
...When ALL of those 26 columns are blank, it can hold up to 200 patients, but still can hold nowhere near all of them
When there's NO vaccination data, it includes up to 500 patients perfectly well, but ommiting the vaccination data is like 26+ columns
My reasoning is that, when it's representing legit. patients with actual vaccination data, it seems to work up to about 100, and since the seed data only makes 100 patients, it's sufficient and runs perfectly fine on my local machine
Okay, to be honest, I'm thinking there might be some kind of limit to how much a csv object can hold in ruby
F) When I run the script with Includes, and have ALL of the vaccination columns just be BLANK, it gives like 200-ish rows, but still not all 500
it gives me like 500-something
E) When I run Patient.includes(camp: [:block, :zone], vaccinations: [:camp, :vaccine]).count on production console
D) If I take the script, and remove all the columns for vaccination-type stuff, then run it on production server, it gives me all 500ish entries, but obviously without vaccination info
C) When I switch out Joins for Includes and run it on the production server, it only gives me the first 120ish rows of data
B) On my local machine, when I switch Joins out for Includes, it runs fine and gives correct data
A) On my local machine, the script will run seemingly forever (I stopped it after 10 minutes)
Symptoms:
Okay, Praneeth, here is the script that I'm using http://rubyfiddle.com/riddles/4dbcd/2
It's generating like 2-3k database queries atleast
Idk if that's good or bad
Update: testing locally, it's taking a lot longer with joins
Like, on the scale of minutes?
Also, should this script really take so long to run?
cuz my lack of DB knowledge is a timesink at the moment
Oh, ok. I think I'm going to do the SQL module on CodeSchool tomorrow
Eager loading versus lazy loading, or something like that, right?
Okay, I think I tried that but lemme see again
use joins?
the data is fine, but leaves out a TON of patients
And some changes, but always the same result
it returns the exact right number (500ish)
B) When I get the count of Patient.includes(camp: [:block, :zone], vaccinations: [:camp, :vaccine])
A) When I run the script locally, it works FINE
It's super disturbing actually...
Ah ok. That script I'm running, it stops after like 100-something queries idk why
Ok awesome, thanks
Or something
I saw it in some example with n+1. I guess my logic that the foreign key would be eager loaded but not the entry
Haha that's a great question. Idk
Okay I'll check it out. Also we're going to be out for a few hours, should be back in 3-4 hours
any idea why?
but theres ~500 patients
also for some reason it's only giving me just over 100 rows
okay
I just changed that a second ago to see if it fixed it
okay, I had it as includes
I wasn't talking about the app, I wrote a separate one
http://rubyfiddle.com/riddles/4dbcd
my b
t
I never sent you the scrip
Wow okay my bad
like dozens and dozens
I spent a while researching N + 1 queries but I still can't figure out why this script is causing so many database queries
Praneeth, I wrote this little script to get some csv data for Ruchit
Before we were using attr_accessor :rescheduled_date, and some of the stuff hadn't changed to reflect that
And I had to rework the reschedule method a bit
There were a couple of places where we were still using the old column names (camp_date)
I got stuck today because the modal was broken
Can we merge calendar_feature?
Okay cool, I'll get working on the OO stuff tonight or tomorrow morning.
although probably all the validations
Maybe 1-2 hours, but probably not enough to handle all the OO stuff and validations
I also probably won't be able to get much done before tomorrow morning at this point, so should I hold off?
Okay, I got started late on the Data Origin stuff because I had to fix a lot of calendar stuff
Hmm, looks good.
But Ruby hashes are dictionaries right? Just naming convention
Yeah that'd be sweet, thanks.
hashes? dynamic arrays? dictionaries? kind of a blurred line when it comes to Ruby, for me at least
Yeah I'm new to the whole hashes game
?
validates :data_origin in {1, 2, 3, 4}
yeah, so like
Doesn't that mean I have to know the valid range of DataOrigin, though?
Okay. You mentioned something about validating inclusion too?
I'm assuming it's an abstract class and not a module though
include ActiveRecord::Base
like in DataOrigin module
Is there any way of doing that enums too?
so we could use validations?
So the module would like extend ActiveRecord or something?
Hmmm ok.
Ruby is pretty dope.
Those are mixins right?
Ahh ok. An enum and not constants?
If all of those models inherited from a common model we could
Hmm is there anywhere we can put an enum?
What do the different integer values correspond to?
Okay. So no changes to the calendar branch then?
Still no ActiveJob stuff for populating camp events
Ok. Anything I should do on my branch?
Actually lets hold off until tonight maybe. I'll work on that - should I add that to your branch or mine?
Okay I will look at your branch. Also, I'm awake. Do you still want to Skype?
Okay, let me know.
If I miss you, is there anything I can work on in the meantime?
I'll let you know as soon as I'm up
Okay tomorrow morning?
I'll be up at probably 9-10 AM Udaipur time (11:30-12:30 PM Yale time) and will go to bed at around 11 PM (12:30 AM tomorrow Yale time)
Could you Skype sometime soon? I'm sort of at a bottleneck
I think we should make Cancellation Reason its own model, so top-level admins can go in and make their own.
Update: I made a bunch of Rubocop fixes, I beefed/cleaned up the Camp Event model, cleaned up the Camp Event controller a lot, deleted the extra files (helper/tests) generated by the scaffold command, and some minor readability changes
(we can rework the jquery code if you think it's too rough)
Also I apologize for adding more features to a single PR - Ruchit said it was a very important feature to have for the tech demo with Seva Mandir's CEO and I thought if I created a separate branch it would be too much
Unfortunately fullcalendar doesn't really support custom headers, so the code I wrote is a bit hack-y
I had to add one small feature to the calendar: the title now displays the number of total and cancelled events for this month
Okay, I fixed some things, still working on them.
Okay, Ruchit also has me filling out some excel sheets from the database so that's gonna take a while.
Actually I like that idea
And I would be down to repurpose delete, but wouldn't we just be changing the http protocol from patch/put to delete? And renaming the path I guess
So I originally wasn't using jbuilder, and it made the as_json method super big. To change the name of the field from "camp_date" to "date" you need to add a new member function called "date" that returns self.camp_date. So it basically mucked up the model too much
navbar*
I just added it as a new lavbar link.
I couldn't find a good place to add the calendar link, so might have to change that
We'll be out the next few hours, Let me know what you think of the new branch
Ah, okay.
Idk why though haha
should we just add Gemfile.lock to gitignore since we're on different platforms? I read you're not really supposed to
Also the PR is up
Yeah
I think it's because bcrypt is in Gemfile.lock but not Gemfile. Whatever that means...
Should I do that and push to master?
Hey Praneeth, I think there's an issue with Gemfile.lock that's preventing me from running on master branch. If I delete Gemfile.lock and run 'bundle', it all works.
I got the Ajax working based on a month by month basis btw
Oh God. Hahaha
Okay I'll use activejob then. It's a rails feature, not a gem, correct?
Oh, mine doesn't have it commented out. Super outdated
Clockwork?
Wait how is it disabled?
Why?
Makes sense. I think I remember seeing that in the Gemfile and was confused about it
Any idea why?
I get clockwork: command not found
but when I run: clockwork clock.rb
that has some code under the perform method to populate the calendar
and I added a file: app/jobs/fill_calendar.rb
every(1.minute, 'calendar.schedule') { FillCalendar.perform_later }
Praneeth, I added a line in clock.rb after the calls.schedule line:
Why?
It's not worth merging in at this point
I'm gonna redo it on a separate branch, since I've been experimenting and broke some stuff
The personal # is one that they can be reached at, and the data upload # is the phone that they use to upload data to the KB app. He said that both fields should be editable, but there only needs to be one number per health worker (so one of the two has to be filled out)
Also, I talked to Ruchit, he says that there should be two phone numbers, one called "Personal Number" and another called "Data Upload Number" or something along the lines of that.
Okay, one last thing. The add_phone_number_to_health_worker branch should also have a phone number field in the edit view for a health worker, right? Right now that field only shows up when you're adding a health worker, but not when you're editing one
I had two other questions, too, one about how to best do a ruby 'enum' and the other about why we're using an admin module now.
There's some stuff in Gemfile.lock that's preventing it from being merged into master, but it's a pretty simple fix, I think.
Hey Praneeth, reviewed your rubocop_fixes PR, it looks good.
Will do.

Yeah the f12 thing is super helpful
the to_s was unnecessary, I actually don't think it's a javascript function even
"/admin/camp_events/" + event.id.to_s + "/edit.js"
Okay there was a typo in my javascript. I had the link as
FINALLY
YES
Hey I got it!!!!!!
So it's coming as a JS request, not an HTML one. A lot of people seemed to have a similar problem, only it says "as HTML"
Started GET "/admin/camp_events/1/edit.js" for 127.0.0.1 at 2015-06-04 23:44:43 +0530 Processing by Admin::CampEventsController#edit as JS
Okay, another clue
No, it's there.
Following the tutorial almost 100% exactly
Like I couldn't get it to render a new partial via ajax even
And I've tried to call some script via ajax a few different ways and none worked
Tbh I think it might be something specific to this application, because I've definitely done ajax before with rails and it always worked no problem.
Like for when the request is finished? I don't need to call pass it a callback function
No callbacks, or anything?
Should the ajax request just be a simple GET?
Yeah.
Actually, the most recent version uses .js
Yeah haha.
??
Should the ending of the url be /edit or /edit.js
Okay, thanks.
Okay, we're getting up early to go to the camp but I'll try it as soon as I get the chance.
Woahh I did not know you could do that.
I.e. It never actually renders the form.
No the javascript is totally correct, but that code isn't being run
my adding_calendar branch is up to date if you wanna try it
admin/camp_events/1/edit.js
if you pasted that into notepad and like opened it in your web browser, it'd look like that
I can send one if you want, but all I get is a totally white page and that text on it
So like the form has been expanded
$('#edit-camp-event-form').html("<form novalidate=\"novalidate\" class=\"simple_form edit_camp_event\" id=\"edit_camp_event_1\" action=\"/admin/camp_events/1\" accept-charset=\"UTF-8\" method=\"post\"><input name=\"utf8\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"&#x2713;\" /><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_method\" value=\"patch\" /><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"authenticity_token\" value=\"Rz8aCZaDrwir5HUpxEt6XYuV4ZonFUz6+bs2nQzhq7QxrHzi7/vXldbsnVRPpaUEKHCiHQSuba/obul673Dbfw==\" /> \n <div class=\'form-inputs\'>\n <div class=\"input select optional camp_event_camp\"><label class=\"select optional\" for=\"camp_event_camp_id\">Camp<\/label><select class=\"select optional chosen-select\" name=\"camp_event[camp_id]\" id=\"camp_event_camp_id\"><option value=\"\"><\/option>\n <option selected=\"selected\" value=\"1\">Chhali (Bagdara)<\/option>\n <option value=\"2\">Chhali (Chhali Bhilwada)<\/option>\n <option value=\"3\">Chhali (Naalkawas)<\/option>\n <option value=\"4\">Jogiyon ka Gura (Dholi Ghati)<\/option>\n <option value=\"5\">Mada (Mada Dang)<\/option>\n <option value=\"6\">Nichla Kaadiya (Nichla Kaadiya)<\/option>\n <option value=\"7\">Undithal (Anejhra Phala)<\/option>\n <option value=\"8\">Kaylo Ka Guda (Chain ka Bhilwada)<\/option>\n <option value=\"9\">Negadiya (Madak)<\/option>\n <option value=\"10\">Badanga (Badanga)<\/option>\n <option value=\"11\">Dhar (Shankar Kheda)<\/option>\n <option value=\"12\">Aad (Nichli Aad)<\/option>\n <option value=\"13\">Krishnapura (Helpiya)<\/option>\n <option value=\"14\">Chanawda (Nala)<\/option>\n <option value=\"15\">Haylikudi (Dabban)<\/option>\n <option value=\"16\">Haylikudi (Haylikudi)<\/option>\n <option value=\"17\">Mohan Dungri (Mohan Dungri)<\/option>\n <option value=\"18\">Sarupal (Bedakudi)<\/option>\n <option value=\"19\">Sarupal (Dagal Bhatda)<\/option>\n <option value=\"20\">Nala (Nala)<\/option>\n <option value=\"21\">Paduna (Lahudara)<\/option>\n <option value=\"22\">Pindoliya (Aamba ka Vela)<\/option>\n <option value=\"23\">Tiloi (Mul Phala)<\/option>\n <option value=\"24\">Aambadeh (Bichla Phala)<\/option>\n <option value=\"25\">Paoti Khurd (Paoti Phala)<\/option>\n <option value=\"26\">Dehri (Dehri)<\/option>\n <option value=\"27\">Ghoramari (Bichla Phala)<\/option>\n <option value=\"28\">Dhedmariya (Bor Phala)<\/option>\n <option value=\"29\">Verakatra (Aamliya Phala)<\/option>\n <option value=\"30\">Maldar Kala (Nichla Phala)<\/option>\n <option value=\"31\">Har (Har Phala)<\/option>\n <option value=\"32\">Bordi Khurd (Bordi Khurd)<\/option>\n <option value=\"33\">Dingavari Nal (Nal Phala)<\/option>\n <option value=\"34\">Maldar Khurd (Maldar Khurd)<\/option>\n <option value=\"35\">Sarli Nal (Nal Phala)<\/option>\n <option value=\"36\">Beelwan (Talab Bhamra)<\/option>\n <option value=\"37\">Beelwan (Khetra Phala)<\/option>\n <option value=\"38\">Bedadher (Holi Phala)<\/option><\/select><\/div>\n <input value=\"2015-06-04\" type=\"date\" name=\"camp_event[camp_date]\" id=\"camp_event_camp_date\" />\n <div class=\"input integer optional camp_event_status\"><label class=\"integer optional\" for=\"camp_event_status\">Status<\/label><input class=\"numeric integer optional\" type=\"number\" step=\"1\" name=\"camp_event[status]\" id=\"camp_event_status\" /><\/div>\n <div class=\"input integer optional camp_event_cancellation_reason\"><label class=\"integer optional\" for=\"camp_event_cancellation_reason\">Cancellation reason<\/label><input class=\"numeric integer optional\" type=\"number\" step=\"1\" name=\"camp_event[cancellation_reason]\" id=\"camp_event_cancellation_reason\" /><\/div>\n <\/div>\n <div class=\'form-actions\'>\n <input type=\"submit\" name=\"commit\" value=\"Update Camp event\" class=\"btn\" />\n <\/div>\n<\/form>\n");
I'll copy paste it in a sec
the whole form is expanded
but where it says #{ j (render 'form') }
$('#edit-camp-event-form').html("#{ j (render 'form') }");
My VM is booting up, but basically what's returned is:
Hold on I'll clarify
Which returns the exact script that I want to run on the page!! The form is all rendered perfectly... So the routing and all happens correctly, but the returned script never runs on the page. Any idea why??
Only thing I tried is disabling forgery protection and going to admin/camp_events/1/edit.js
I have literally no clue why it's not working, and I'm not really sure how to debug it.
(inside the div with id="edit-camp-event")
This should render the form partial for the requested camp event, right?
$('#edit-camp-event-form').html("#{ j (render 'form') }");
In views/admin/camp_events/edit.js.haml, I have the following code
which should accept ajax requests, because of the :js (I'm a little fuzzy on this step)
def edit respond_to :js, :html end
I have the following function:
in the CampEventController
i.e. to admin/camp_events#edit
$.ajax({ url: "/admin/camp_events/" + event.id.to_s + "/edit" });
When an event is clicked on in the calendar, it makes the following ajax request:
Okay Praneeth, I THINK what I'm doing should work. Tell me if there are any flaws in my thinking
Ok I am on skype
Are you still awake?
Sorry I'm here, give me five
8:30 AM for me
Okay. I'm already in bed so (my) tomorrow might be better for this (later today for you). Does 10:00 PM EST work for you?
Okay fair point, I can tweak that
Well, it is haha but it's getting them all at once.
It's not atm I think.
Hmm. Is it using Ajax now?
One issue with making one modal for each camp event, is that the calendar actually loads ALL camp events in history, i.e. past, present, and future, and that many modals might be too much.
Other reason is that it makes the whole modal deal a lot simpler. The modal would just render the "new" partial the Cancellation model.
A few reasons. One is that they said they wanted some kind of form where you give a REASON for cancelling, and like the optional ability to reschedule on a day that same month. It doesn't really seem right to put that data (reason for cancelling) on the camp event itself
"
So campcontroller#edit would basically say "for all campevents after today that belong to this camp, move them to the new day of the month
so a Camp model, a Camp Event model, and a Cancellation model
I'm saying in addition to Camp Events
Okay. What did you think about the Cancellation model option?
I also pushed to my test production server, causes same error there.
app/views/layouts/admin/base.html.haml
I can give you offending file, hold on
Haml::SyntaxError at /admin
Illegal nesting: content can't be both given on the same line as %li and nested within it.
Mine works up until "Made haml template a bit more compact"
Also, are you 100% sure that your version of master works?
Definitely adds some complexity.
And a description or something.
We make a Cancellation model, and at the bottom of the modal, there's a form for a new cancellation, prompting reason, etc.
Okay, Praneeth, what about this? The modal has some information about the camp, camp event, and a link to the edit form for both.
Okay. Sounds good.
Okay one potential issue with using 20+ modals. If someone's javascript is screwy, that has the potential to fully render all 20 modals, right?
I still have a working (slightly outdated) version of adding_crud_geography so I'm demo-ing with that
Oh, okay. Yeah something is messed up with mine than, I'll figure it out after
We're at the tech meeting atm
Hey Praneeth, just warning I think there's some issue with master at the moment, I did a pull on master and it wouldn't go
There has to be a link to the edit form for the camp as well inside the modal, same as the list view
Camp Event
Well, that could be a link in the modal
The info is no problem since I included the camp info in the json
It just has to have a few links to cancel/move it and some info
Haha really? The other thing is that I don't think we ever specified that we need an edit form in the modal itself
So clicking the event would essentially send an ajax request to edit.js.erb or whatever, and it would let you update the modal with an edit form for Camp Event A as soon as the request makes it through
Yeah. Since there's only one modal, it would have to be responsive such that when you click on Camp Event A, which is attached to Camp 1, it will have the modal pop up with an edit form for Cam Event A.
So I can't get the partial to load. I've done it before in rails without probs, idk what it is about this application
I got the same error as when I was trying jbuilder stuff, mainly it won't recognize a "new.js.erb" view
Modal is working but not very dynamic. I tried to get a working edit form inside the modal window when you click on a camp event, but I ran into ajax issues
I have to figure out some way to actually populate the table of camp_events from the camps 3 months in advance though, so I have to work on that and the modal today
Okay sounds good. I've also made some good progress on the calendar feature.
Look good?
Ok should be good
Ok, so you added two commits to the branch, right?
Okay give me five
Ok my b I'll do that
Is there something besides editing now? Or did I not push the tab/whitespace changes
Also what do you mean Jbuilder is pure ruby code? I thought it was a template, or handler, or whatever that let's you customize your json? So like /event.json would render views/events/index.json.jbuilder. So how would you put it inside haml?
I don't have to manually add a .json route though, right? The route would be admin/events(.:format)
so no events controller?
okay, let me try that hold on
loosely following http://blog.crowdint.com/2014/02/18/fancy-calendars-for-your-web-application-with-fullcalendar.html
I installed the gem and it still won't go, gives me that same error
I'm just curious, how WOULD we get a jbuilder view to render?
Okay I think I got it working without jbuilder, but I used as_json, not to_json
but I keep getting: Missing template api/events/index, api/base/index with {:locale=>[:en], :formats=>[:json], :variants=>[], :handlers=>[:erb, :builder, :raw, :ruby, :coffee, :haml]}. Searched in: * "/home/tyler/Documents/khushibaby/app/views"
I have a views/api/events/index.json.jbuilder view
Praneeth, do you know how to get jbuilder working on our app?

Okay sweet. Should we populate month x on the first of the month? Or should we do it like three months in advance
ty.petrochko@gmail.com
Praneeth?
Also let me know if what I'm doing makes absolutely no sense and my understanding of Mysql/SSH is 500% skewed, because I'm slowly getting that feeling as time goes on
The command I'm using is (found from a few online tutorials) "ssh trellisdb@aa1rz1d4tlcpm05.csqvj84gzabv.ap-southeast-1.rds.amazonaws.com -L 3306:127.0.0.1:3306 -N -i ~/Documents/KhushiBaby.pem" where the last arg. is the path to the public key you sent
Hey Praneeth, how do I ssh into the mysql database you set up for the surveying program? Ruchit's tablet's can't correctly pull any data from the server, so I was thinking I'd try to manually ssh in first and see if that works.
I pretty much added what you have for camps for blocks and zones, so you can edit them. I'm gonna put the soft-delete feature in a separate branch/pr
Sounds good, I should have a PR out by the end of the day
Okay, should I just run it on the ones I edited?
(The same thing happens when I run it on master branch)
Am I missing a paramater or something? 99% of the files it's detecting offenses for I haven't modified at all.
When I run rubocop -v, I get 0.29.1
When I run "rubocop" in the project root directory, I'm getting tons of errors from pretty much every file. As an example: "db/migrate/20150405200140_add_role_to_user.rb:1:1: C: Missing top-level class documentation comment. class AddRoleToUser < ActiveRecord::Migration ^^^^^"
Hey Praneeth, I'm finished with the editing Blocks/Zones feature, but I'm a little confused by Rubocop
Actually nvm I got it
Also Praneeth/Abhi, could one of you invite me to the Trello? I still don't have access yet
Okay, great.
(two separate links)
Also what do you think about having nav links under the data tab for Zones/Blocks and re-using your Camps index view?
and some camps happen to be in the same village
Ahh okay, so for all intensive purposes in the application, it's Block > Zone > Camp
For camps/hamlets, it seems like the revenue village is entered manually, not via a dropdown
Is there anything in the db for revenue villages? A model or anything?
Also, Praneeth, when you get the chance could you go over the database (and real-life) relationship between villages and camps? I'm a little confused as to exactly what a camp is
Haha figured. Np
Hey Praneeth, for editing villages/blocks/zones, I was thinking of having nav links under the "Data" tab for Vilages, Blocks, and Zones, and then pretty much mimicking your "Camps" page for each.
Sounds good, I'll do that
Should I make a PR and/or issue?
Is it just me though? If not I can make a PR for it
When I cloned the repository, I think my local app/bin folder was out of date or something, because I had to run rake rails:update:bin and push to heroku before I could remotely access the console.
Hey Praneeth, are you able to remotely access rails console on heroku?
I believe either Shahnawaz or Ruchit is sending us an email with all this stuff.
5.) Shahnawaz said there's some glitch where some entries for denials are showing up twice, so we need to get that ironed out.
4.) They want better data interpretations for denial reasons, retention, and camp attendance. I'm not sure what type of stuff is in place now, but they mentioned something about a pie-chart (not sure if this is an already-existing feature or an idea for one). They also tossed around the idea of a map with GPS coordinates.
I think for that last feature, they want to have the list show both active and cancelled camps as well, so there's a place to see all camps at once, rather than seeing them only by block. At the top there would be something like "Number of cancellations this month: xx"
3.) A camp calendar feature that shows the camps on each given day, with some way of differentiating camps that are active from camps that are cancelled. On the same page or close-by, it is also important to have a list of cancelled camps by date/month. This way they can see how many camps were cancelled in May, June, etc.
2.) More update/edit buttons on dashboard for uploading vaccine reminder voice files (apparently only Praneeth has the power to do this)
1.) The ability to edit higher-level geography (Praneeth and I talked about this). Right now you can edit villages, but I think we need to be able to edit/delete blocks and zones, and a feature to delete camps
(from Seva Mandir)
Hey guys, I talked to Ruchit and Shahnawaz, it seems like these are the main things they want
so peace nigz
that is due tomorrow
yes, everything you need is in there. anyway, i gotta go do an english proj
shhhhh sh shhh
and just a really organized design to hold all your components in a way that allows you to effectively place them within scenes
Mecanim, which we talked about earlier
it also has a particle simulator
the most important thing is a physics engine
except artistic functions, like texturing and modeling
so anything you need to make a game, it includes
it's a game engine
partially, yes
words trey, words
the best resource for blender is that site i showed you
Callahan you seem to know what you're doing with blender and whatnot
for now, Trey - find some introductory tutorials to Unity3D
no worries though.
haha alright. idk how much i can help you with them, but i was really into them in middleschool/freshman year
alright so you're pretty well off
or even like, zbrush
alright good, have you done anything with photoshop, Gimp, Paint.net, or anything like that?
also, Callahan are you interested in graphics and texturing and whatnot?
and when you bring someone else in, it can screw with the balance
the best game design teams consist of a really dedicated scripter, and a really dedicated modeler
if i find any kids that are willing to help out, i'll talk to them
shhhhh
trey?
moron
no, as in the in-game scripting is all you
no but seriously don't be weird trey haha
can now be done in like, 40 minutes, without any scripting
so what used to be like, an optimistically 50 hour script-reliant arduous process
which lets you use a blender rig to actually generate in-game IK constraints, build animations, and do real-time procedural animations
recently released an AddOn called Mecanim
Unity3D
the game engine you guys will be using
lucky*
you guys are insanely luck
yeah start with you two
Think you lost him
and also, i'm gonna remind you again, stop getting attached to the idea that you're just going to be working on one game.
hmm, ask around. i find a lot of freshman guys seem to have an interest in videogame design, so it shouldn't be too hard to find some that would help you out
haha i'm going to help you, but i won't have time to do more than help you learn to script, review your scripts, answer questions, laugh at you, etc.
if Callahan is going to be doing game design, he'll learn to script too, although scripting in Python can be very useful in modeling, although not to the same extent as in game design
and second off, YOU'RE going to be scripting it mainly, ideally using JavaScript or C#
you're going to be doing SCRIPTING
first off, you're not going to be doing any programming
Eyyy yo
Oo ok

Yeah, you seem like a REALLY nice, really cool, and really pretty. Like I would love to know you better, but the thing is I'd be the only Sophomore going, and I don't really know any juniors. If I had a lot of friends going or I knew you super well it would probably be different... I'm really sorry but I don't think it would be a good idea to go. Plus I'm like super super awkward at parties where I don't know anybody. This is like totally not an issue with you it's an issue with me...

Thankyouuuu
Alright sweet haha
http://quizlet.com/14691364/spanish-verbs-wb-test-one-indicative-flash-cards/
she wrote 188 it should be 118
wait...nvm she just miswrote the first one
hey uhm so that email Mrs. Romeu sent us... none of those pages have vocab on them
blaaaaaaaaaaah you too
haha anything to cut corners...alright i'ma go study but i'll be back before ten with another quizlet most likely
and throw in some "I learned that..." at the beginning of the sentences
if i have time before i go to bed I'll revise it a bit
yeah
i should probably fix that :/
yeah that's what it was supposed to be about
balls
sweet...honestly i learn a thing from that museum so wiki was kinda my best friend there
"unas 200 palabras"
she says it has to be "some 200 words"
like 230?
you'll be fine
no probz :D
good stuff
what's the diff between archaea and bacteria, etc.
like what's the different between a protist and a fungi,
the different characteristics of all the domains and kingdoms
are like
the two things that might my study guide didn't cover
hmm
no prob, also she sent an email with the actual pages that the vocab comes from
that goes with Abriendo pasas
the orange workbook thingy
uh i don't think there's anything from the AP book on there, just from like
when i'm done studying this one I'll probably do one on all the verbs we have to know from the workbook
haha no problem
http://quizlet.com/14688373/rosaura-1-3-vocab-flash-cards/
http://quizlet.com/14582955/bio-study-guide-1-2-275-flash-cards/
and like the 400 questions associated with it?
Ev for Spanish we do Ch three in Rosaura?
okay haha cya
well you can't get paid...but the class is horrible it's four weeks, eight hours per day, and like 4-6 hours of homework per night
EMT class haha I'll start working on an ambulance
nopee haha I'm taking a class outside of GA so I have way too much work anyway. If you start it let me know...it looks horrible
by the way, did you start the AP stuff yet?
okay haha i will
No haha it's fine don't worry about it, my phone can't get pics, I was just curious because I haven't gotten mine and you're the only person that lives as far away from school as I do
Ev did you get your schedule yet?
alright haha i'll let you know
yeah and ap is probably going to suck anyway...
i think i might just stay in regular history
aww thanks ev
if that meant anything whatsoever haha
yeahhh... but I mean matt will be doing all that too
well i'm not sure I might be doing AP history and AP english
are you doing the other AP's?
alright i guess i'll probably do it
are you sure that you can?
haha the whole concept of being on the same level as matt is just terrifying
matt miller haha
are you?
uhm i'm still in the process of deciding haha
haha np bud
except the last partt
no haha i copy pasted
minus FeSCN concentration at equilibrium
take initial Fe3+ concentration
basically
Knowing the [FeSCN 2+ ]eq allows you to determine the concentrations of the other two ions at equilibrium. For each mole of FeSCN 2+ ions produced, one less mole of Fe 3+ ions will be found
sec
alright hold on a sce
do you have the lab sheet
haha yeah hold on a sec
yeah whatsup
sweet thanks Cherise!
Hey dudes, Andrew and I are planning on rooming together, sound good with everyone?
Yeah that might be a sound decision.
Actually I guess fridge/microwave would go in the common area right? So it doesn't matter
Haha the only downside to no assigned roommates is the fact that we can't really effectively split up the gear
I don't have either so I'd have to buy one hbu?
Okay sounds good, do we want to organize the fridge/microwave thing?
Hey guys, can't wait to meet you all, do you wanna decide who's bringing what?
okay thanks
for me?
just shut up?

I didn't write about it yet, but yesterday I saw a flock of like 40 monkeys!!
The city I'm in is like an Indian version of Venice, it's all surrounded by these tall mountains with temples and huge lakes with fountains... Absolutely amazing
And if I need any advice I'll hit him up! Luckily I'm staying with all Hindi-speakers, and one guy who lives nearby, so I'm usually pretty safe and happy.
So even if I run or do HIIT in the early morning, I'll drink like 2 liters and probably douse myself in 2-3 more
Only hard part is that exercise is very difficult... It gets to be 90° by 8 AM, and peaks at around 1 PM at like 105-110°
Thanks Deb!! India is absolutely amazing. The people are very friendly, especially towards westerners. People come up and talk to me and go out of their way to be kind, plus the food is insanely tasty
Awesome dude you too! Enjoy your second decade!!! 󾆵󾆵
Yeah it's like an "English intro writing 114"
Multivariable calc, Farm bill and policy of agriculture, intro to programming, and intro german 😎
Tis fantastic haha. What're you taking?
How's harvard?!
Happy birthday dude!
that's kinda interesting though, never really thought about a mac
okay good point
really? you don't find compsci on a mac challenging?
also I'm not a mac person tbh
from what I've seen it's more 50/50
Oh prob PC
like what seems to be the best/most common brand?
hey dude do you have any thoughts on getting a pc for college?
Thanks dude, you rock
but thanks so much dude :D you're the best
I'm going to Yale haha awkward

Haha of course dude, poor ants though
They did a freaking giant one in Australia like 20 x bigger
I've spent like hours watching these videos




BEEE
"Sometimes you feel like a nut."
Or maybe "unexplainably juicy."
I'm gonna remember that
Found that online
There we go
"Melts in your mouth, not in your hands. Enjoy m&ms."
Couldn't think of anything better :(
Hehe
And whisper in your ear, "taste the rainbow"
And spoon you and wrap my big muscley arms around your chest
I want to watch you sleep
You can snuggle in my bed any time hon
😍😍😍 perfect girlfriend material
That picture of you snuggling the cheetah 😳
Come tackle meeeee
Meeee!
Haha sweetie yes that was weird honey
Hi!!
But it kills me
🐘
Idk if I've ever mentioned that
I also like skirts
Yes baby 💋💋💋
😘
Okay go sleepie
😍😍
Or like skinny dark jeans and anything pretty much
Sooo sexy
And a thin scarf
But I really like you in jean shorts and a black shirt
Okay internet too slow
I'm gonna find you what I think is a sexy outfit on you
Haha I love you
Babe so many of my messages don't go through
<3
oh okay haha
and I no likie hehe
I think there's only one tanktop you have that's mustard
I like earth tones, but not mustard or browny yellow
although I'm not huge on really brownish/mustardy faded colors
Haha but you look sexy in anything
like I like when you wear dark red or pink shorts
actually not necessarily bright, but vibrant
I really like when you wear bright colors
no just out of all your outfits
I'm trying to think of my favorite outfit on you
aww meekie you know me
I'll dress up as a greaser for you every now and then
hehe <3
beeeeke
he looks more hipsterie though
and I like the men's 2015
although I don't think 2005 is that bad
like the top of the 2015 + the bottom of 2005
they would look better tighter, personally
I really like 2015 too
Yeah
I hate jumpsuits
no beekie! no no no!!
eww the jumpsuit!
Yeah I knew you like the greaser look
White and pink mm
honestly 1985 without the mullet is nice
My favorite is the 1925 men
I know meekie haha
I literally cannot believe the 1995 one
and the 1995 one the least
I bet you like the Greaser one the most
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaSkMWVlFUU
I find it
tell meee mee
do itttt
which is your favorite for men?
yay!
mee! there's one for men too
https://video-iad3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hvideo-xta1/v/t43.1792-2/11327786_855369157877568_159398864_n.mp4?efg=eyJybHIiOjE1MDAsInJsYSI6MTAyNH0%3D&rl=1500&vabr=241&oh=9e8b16a823ec4f4ccaca2cc1264b107b&oe=55D16043
did you find your life jacket?
I'm thinking of you in your underwear
thank you meekie
plus I'm writing my Khushi baby report!
and I have boxers
my phone in the other room
I'm sorry but the internet is super bad here
Babe you know that you're the fairest princess in all the lands, and nothing could ever sway me away from you
I know! You'll be okay
Meekie if you just keep being healthy you be okay!
You don't look any chubbier! I gain weight randomly all the time
You're not chubbie baby!!
Baby you're not chubbie!!!
Who no chubbie
You're a little kitty
Nooo
Hehe cutie

Meekie!!
Kisssssssie
Baby kiss me kiss me
I will kiss you all day!!
Baby!
Beeee
Haha beer
And sustain yourself from cuddling alone
If you needed
But I feel like you could go forever without sex
And you like sex hopefully
But you give me unlimited sex hehe yaaaaaaasssssss
Meee
Ooo is that love disease
I think guys will go to greater lengths for sex than girls will in order to find a worthwhile mate
Yup
I'm serious babe, maybe not a smart and caring worthwhile one willing to have a meaningful relationship, but there's always a guy willing to do the crayon dance if it means a date (and sexie potentially)
Yeah, advice from men
And yessss I'll dress like a lavender crayon and twerk for you any day of the week
Since there's always another guy waiting in line
So guys trying to set "dating standards" for women is a bit ridiculous
I mean if girls wanted to make guys dress like crayons and perform a complex mating ritual in order to go on dates, they could totally make us 0.0
Also no matter what women will rule the dating world, since they control the sexie
It would be super easy to fake that
Haha I wonder if that's legitimate or not
you comie over?
I done with foodie!
ok
tyty make a bit of food first
I come ova
okay
?
so I come over
like 5ish
jamie said later we'll go to outlets

would you want to come with me and jamie?
I might be able to go to the outlets
yes that would be cool!
meeeeEEeeEE!!
Yes beek!
I almost skipped over it because it wasn't great quality and I didn't get it
but it makes me want to laugh and cry at the same time
I don't even get it 100%

okay bee??
I'm gonna pick you up in like an hour and a half
babe!
so i'll workout, go to your house, then call the mother
no one knows when we're eating
ok
I'll go check
depends when we're going to dinner
I know meekie! but you can't be super ocd about it
when you live on your own, you can eat whatever you want
it's pretty unavoidable
it's also natural to put on SOME weight when you come home
workout hard, eat clean, and you'll get there
I know babe!
wot is curry
red lentil wot, shiro wot, yellow peas, green beans with carrot, tomato wot, and red beets
so you can't be obsessed about the number! if you weigh yourself right now it'll be different
bathroom scales, at least
so really when you weigh yourself it's only giving you the correct weight within like 5-10 pounds
also, babe as a wrestler scales can be super inaccurate
but you look great babe! literally better than ever before
you probably weighed yourself right after you ate baby
they have a vegetarian platter
well you should come to dinner with us!
oh ok
mon-tues?
sunday too?

yeah haha

Yes meeee goo for it
Not everyone would do that, I'm very proud of course
You're a good guide haha.
Good meemee <3
You too meekie. On the tolerance front baby is way up there
Haha beeeeee
I'm doing a lot to work on my tolerance
Haha it was actually ok
for 2 and a half hours
I was a good Tyty
I just laughed
and I was literally 100% fine
and kicked me, threw food at me,
while the kids screamed at each other- literally they were having a screaming contest -
And the dad slept, the mom just stared out the window,
Yesterday, on the train, I was in a tiny compartment with a Turkish family with two boys
Tyty's anger levels are very much on the rise
Plus the internet goes at a snail's pace
And my 1 year of german is not enough for like, techie stuff
is that everything is in german
What makes this all way more frustrating
We get a copy of office 2013 and 2010, and she didn't
So I'm getting her a copy through yale
ugh
Like, email addresses, passwords, dates,
I can't reinstall microsoft office
But because she literally forgot EVERYTHING
I offered to fix it
Yeah, but it's my fault really.
Babe, the whole day.
I've spent the whole day trying to fix Steffie's computer
Ugh I'm in such a bad mood right now haha
You're burning a lot of calories, though hon, so at least you're not atrophying like Tyty
How did she forget her last phone number?!
I don't know
Steffie, what's the PHONE number you used with your account?
I don't know
Steffie, what's your email?
I don't know
Steffie, what's your password?
Working with non technical people is very frustrating
I know meekie, thank you meekie
Ahh trying to help Steffi with a computer thing
On steffie's computer
She havie a crushy crushy
Haha meeeee!

loveeee
okay! I'm gonna see berlin one more time!
tell mee mee
meekie! what're you doing

I can't wait to see you so soon
i love you baby!!!
(yes, agreed) ;D
ja, stimmt
yes, i think we should do another trip first though
so we have to commit to it meekie?
we should decide on hiking dates then decide if we want to do it!!
yes meekie, but that might be the best time for us to do a hikie
<3
beee
neeeee
hmm you need to take people looking at you as a compliment sometimes
I do think you need to be more openminded a bit though sometimes
thank you honey
I know hon, I know
meeeeekie
if you ask an evolutionary biologists they'd say it's all about sex
depends on who you ask babe
hmmm
i know meeps
You should meeks
oo... okay i go back on that then
idk if i ever said that literally
tbh ive kinda changed my mind on that, you should take one
grab the nuts, etc
yeah but if you poked a guy in the eye you'd be okay
and if a guy is forceful, you can always fight dirty...exactly
baby, don't drink too much, don't do any drugs, and you will be fine
you'll be okay sweetums
you've mentioned
I know sweety
being strong is scary sometimes
you have to be strong
you'll be fine <3
baaabe
goodnight my chestnut lover
<3
and tomorrow is packie day!
Tyty is very sleepy
Mhmm yes meeks
Because hes a dumbo haha
to fly the confederate flag
Abhi told me he thinks it should be illegal
yes meepy
So just ask
If people know someone is a racist, they will probably stay away from them
You should ask them WHY they're flying it, then judge them accordingly
And if someone is flying that flag, you shouldn't jump at them for flying it
Every single person might see it differently
keep in mind that it's literally just a bunch of colors... it's not like it has "one meaning"
yes
prominently, in fact
Exactly, but keep in mind the KKK also flew that flag
And yes honey, you have to ask them why then!
very related issue
So some words, in some countries, will mean something like "piece" but in another country it means "asshole" or "shit"
In spanish speaking countries, every single country has its own unique cursewords
Hmm
You have to ask them then, hon
I mean, the Dukes of Hazard have a confederate flag on the top of their car but they're obviously not racist haha
Nor have I really seen one in the north
Ive never known anyone that flies it, hon
so they ought to be ashamed of themselves
which is, in fact, the exact same mentality that invented slavery and racial profiling in the first place -.-
when they literally have no idea what they're doing - theyre just following their peers
and especially at northern universities, you get this mob mentality when you hear about people waving that as a banner
like literally, not a single person has ever done any research into this whole thing, haha
like honestly to make a blanket statement like that you have to be veeeeeeery ignorant and misinformed
so you have a ton of people saying "All it is is a symbol of a divided country and slavery"
and there are some that share both viewpoints, but are just following their friends
And there are also people who fly the flag and see it as a symbol of racial pride and are making a xenophobic statement
although I bet those peoplare are very, very, few in number
There are also people that, yes, believe it or not, still want a divided country
Which obviously does not stand for a divided nation
i.e. in WWII a lot of military batallions flew it, if they were mostly consistent of southern soldiers
There are people that see the confederate flag and view it as a sign of southern culture and heritage, and in no way link it to racism
My opinion is that everyone on both sides of the debate is making ignorant claims about the other side, and no one's taking the time to actually do any research OR listen to someone who has done research
the confederate flag?
I mighta been robbed meekie
haha welll
not super sure
haha great question
hold your tyty
Yesss, today I imagined you were with me in Hamburg
Haha you have no idea how much I've been thinking about you

Yesss rickie's glenn is very prutty
How was rickets glen meekie?? did you jump in the waterfalls??
Meekie tell me about your day

Tons and tons of cool shops lined up
Huge vaulted ceilings and a terminal big enough to fit a blimp
It was super hogwartsy
Hmm I really really liked the main train station
Haha I spent all day thinking about you

meeeeee
Haha babe!
I look like a dodo there
I look like a dodo
Haha babe nooo
but we should do an anniversary date night when we get back!
<3
they're usually pretty expensive in the city, though
We can go to Philly or NY for Indian food if you want meekie
and I know meekie
BEEE
Like I'll send Earl cool stuff when I find it
just occasional snap chats or brief articles
Other than Jason and Jamie, I don't talk to any guy friends online
But guy friends don't talk like that in the US so it's hard! I tell him yes but idk
he asks me 10 times a day if I'm going to still talk to him after I leave
but Alam might be too far for me
haha yes
yep probably haha
Mee mee <3
it's cute but a little weird, honestly
and we were planning to go out yesterday and he wanted me and him to sneak off and leave her behind so she couldn't take any time away from us!
there's another intern here, and it's just the three of us
he's so greedy with time with me!
Just hanging out with Alam, packing, etc
hahaha doofus
and for like 10 minutes, before every exercise he'd mention a different famous person, either English, Indian, or some Hindi God
and he was like "OH Michael Jackson! Yes! You Jackson! HA! HA!"
we did one where we swayed our hips
and the instructor would say stuff, then come and stand two feet in front of me and say it in english while making some joke haha
I did everything! I'm sure they would've been offended if I hadn't
Haha nooo, literally we just had to burst out laughing
like they had us bend down, then reach up and laugh really loudly while exhaling
Ahh okay nevermind then. Yeah they had us do laughing stuff
but you also say a sexy person is "cute"
like you'd say a dog is cute
because you know how in English it has two meanings?
I'm not sure he knows the exact connotation of cute to be honest
I looked at the thing you sent me haha
Yeah Alam was being kind of flirty haha
haha probabyl
he told me to ask you
Also how's Alam's english?
Nooo haha not at all
There were lots of weird things that they had us do
the only white person, as usual haha
and TyTy
It was like 40 middle-aged men and women
Bae it was so much fun!
I just did yogi!!
baby!!!!
tomorrow night tyty will be packing so no bro time
sunday!
sleepie time
Tyty sleepy
:D
eat me
Haha baby calm calm
yay <3 <3
YAY!!
Federally?
Wait wha?
my legs are so tight! I need jessie massage
Yesss I'm still waiting for Jamie to be there
I don' likey her!
:D
I told him to hehe
I almost died! we were out in the field four hours and I had poop cramps
also I had bad cramps today haha
hahaha no
<3
babe! tonight is my last night to chill with Alam so he wants us to bro bond
haha noooo
beekie!
It tastes exactly like funnel cake
http://www.ultrahd4kwallpaper.in/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/jalebi-sweet-images-1.jpg
Hold on, Jalebi is soo good
http://www.buzzfeed.com/niralishah/bhook#.bf4P2rpnmM
Babe!!! So true
I can't use my phone because Ruchie took his charger with him
Baby! are you up??
BAAAA
phone's not working
skype!
babe!

Hahahahaha I got it
Okay... You know that crazy monkey experience I always wanted??
Babe!!!
Craziest thing of my life just happened
Babe
I feel much better
Okay off to a monkey temple!
I just left him and got food from a street vendor
He's like 126 and says he's five nine
He has skinny boy abs
Admittedly
Haha his are probably better
I think it would be exciting
Also I've been thinking... You should consider taking up lifting!
I'm also cranky, and too stubborn to eat while Abhi watches me
Why couldn't everyone be Earl babe
He just brings a bad name to fitness
And everything is just some competition to him of who can eat fewer calories and do more push-ups
Of course he drinks like a full bottle of sprite today
But it makes me feel like a fat fuck when I'm eating and he's just sipping tea or eating a single piece of bread
I realize I'm not taking the best way, I.e I should just live and let live
Tbh I would totally rather just eat alone
"Oh yeah I'll keep you company at dinner but I don't think I'll eat anything."
Like he literally only works out two muscles, has zero understanding of anything regarding nutrition, and just says shit like "oh but that has too many carbs" or "oh my god. So many calories"
He's saying like "oh I'm just not really feeling food. Just not hungry"
We got breakfast, and he's refusing to eat any more food today
Sometimes Abhi's self consciousness really bothers me... Like its so annoying
Baby baby baby
Pink city! Lots of camels
We're in Jaipur!
Haha babe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AnRJXsLMUo < super famous indian song
Meekie ❤️ okay I'm gonna go for a quick run!
Haha I was pretty sober by then
Mee!
Meekie!
cute haha
Babe!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr76WikS6o8
Talk to you tomorrow ❤️
Me mee tired
󾰴󾰴󾰴
Only now it's only me. And yes
We're both like this when we're tired
Okay meemee
So now we're on temp wifi
Called load-shedding
It's like scheduled
That happens haha
The power went out
phone's dead
Babe! skype?

Yes! The apartment is amazing!
sorry I'm working with Abhi
you still there?
BEEE
they're like worshipped here, so they just walk across the street whenever they want
Haha, they're completely free
They're friendly! You can just pet them
like every street has at least two moo moos
like cows in Udaipur are more common the squirrels where we are
also, there are cows everywhere
The streets are freaking INSANE
it's so cool!
Mmhmm! People are like carrying stuff in baskets on their head as they walk by my apartment window
like across the runway
bocking his way out of the plane
hehe
Yes! there was a bock bock on the airplane runway
I love you too!! India is amazing! It's everything I hoped for and more!
BEEEE
Early morning?

One sec
Mmhmm!
Eek
Hahaha I saw this...
Go sleepie
Yes bee ❤️
Cottage cheese is made the same way as skim I believe. But meep keep
Yeah I know, isn't skim milk too though?
You don't think cottage cheese is healthy? All the fitness geeks I know eat it religiously
I know, I do worry about the amount of animal fat I'm getting though. I know like two yolks and some cottage cheese isn't much fat but it's all saturated
I go through like 2 cartons of eggs in three days
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Nine egg whites haha
Hard to not break the yolk. Did it today though! Twice!
It's a very difficult ratio though haha
The last three days I've put like five egg whites with two regular eggs and made easy over eggs... Freaking amazing
YESSSS bee my favorite thing...
They need to be brown somewhere
Like he doesn't make them crispy ever...
Aww I was just thinking that tonight!
My dad still makes me eggs haha. He's horrible at cooking them but I still love it
Because eggs are quite possibly my favorite food and they're so simple but it's such a gesture of love
For my bee bee to make me eggs
I want you to know that
That's been my fantasy all along in this relationship
Okay bee! I totally support either. If I bring you my chicken eggs will you make eggs for me? 󾌧󾌧󾌧
I'm not trying to say you should!!
Will you still eat cottage cheese though?
When you like mash up raspberries they turn to goo

Yeah in a bit
Cottage cheese and raspberries mmm
Beeee❤️
That's cute too
Aww bee!!
⛄️⛄️⛄️
That's how I feel for you ba ba
Haha you competitive little monkey

Yesss bee!!

and I love when you grasp my arm in your tiny hands and pull me close
I love your neck <3 how it's so tiny and nuzzle-able
mmm very kissable
and these soft little lips :D
it's tiny and you form it into this evil little grin sometimes when you look at me
and I love your mouth
and you blow bubbles and just give me that killer lok
and you look like a mermaid who's just intent on wooing your prey
and your eyes look so damn big
so that your nose and lips are underwater
and especially when you're underwater
I love you're eyes
lost in a tide of green-eyed and blue-eyed monstrosities
it makes me think that we're two very weird critters of the same species
I love your big brown eyes that look exactly like mine
I couldn't see that

when it's dark out
when you go scuba diving at night
the first time we went
like holy shit
and night dives are freaking terrifying
they are haha
it looks like a giant daddy long-leg but underwater
crab
I also saw a spider crap today
they have big ass pincers
I"m too afraid haha
apparently they'll clean your fingernails if you let them
one of the ones from Finding Nemo
baby I saw a cleaner shrimp
I'm a small part of my beeblet
one entity
we're one
I feel like I'm connected to you
I like that you wear my sunglasses
BOOM
YES
the white-red ones?
YES GET EM BAE
yeah me too. I don't know what I would do honey <3
let's experiment
I'll watch some with you
really :D
and tomorow afternoon another
we went yesterday and the day before I think

but I'm still ballooning haha
I've been trying to do some sort of exercise every day too
yes bee as are you
tell me you love meeee

and when you waved your hand, the light would turn sparkly with bioluminescence
today we did a crazy night dive
and we don't really have any pictures bee 0.0 but I can show you all the different creatures we've seen
Tyler was not very gifted at GaGa as an 11 year old
he was really good and almost always won and I would always get kicked out of the court
I love GaGa... Jason and I used to play that every day in fifth grade haha
baby!

hehe <3
adios <3
<3 <3 ciao my love

yessssss <3 I'll be home soon beebee and I'll try to message you again before I come back
or a seadonkey
I hope I see a seahorse
I'll tell you more when I get back :D :D :D your beebles is about to go diving again
I have to go bee bee!
BEE
BE
we've been diving at least 2-3 times per day, and I've seen turtles, giant parrotfishes, giant tarpin (scary 4-5 foot fishes that are super freaky), sea cucumbers, lobsters, shrimpies, crabs, moray eels, sand-eels, and tons of adorable fishies
there are also quite a few wild-ranging donkeys here which are VERY cute... you'd love it beebles <3
there are free-ranging goats that just go around eating stuff... they're like everywhere haha.
It's absolutely great here... it's not really a tropical island but rather a giant fucking desert filled with iguanas and goats and lots and lots of cactuses...
Hey babe! I can't send texts here and nobody wants to let me use their phone so I'm just hoping you'll see this message!
Yay 󾌫󾌫󾌫 okay brb trash

Hmm
Thanks babe! You too!!
might be easier to read if you paste it in word...
my online interview!
1. What is the name of your software? As of now the program doesn’t really have an official “name,” but I’ve been referring to it as SP Geography, or Stephens-Petrochko (Mark Stephens is a middle school history teacher who has acted as my mentor throughout the process and gave me the original idea). 2. How long did it take for you to create it? Including meeting with my mentor, writing code, debugging features, and designing the interface, probably about 120-140 hours. I finished most of the coding last summer, and am now mostly in a debugging phase. 3. How did you create it? I coded my application in Java, using the JavaFX framework (a coding library that facilitates user-friendly graphical interfaces). 4. Why did you create it? (solely from conversations with Mr. Stephens?) When Mr. Stephens told me that there wasn’t much good “geography-teaching software” out there, I was pretty skeptical because it seems like there’s a program for everything nowadays. But, after looking around some, I decided that it wouldn’t really be that hard to make an easy-to-use application for a range of curricula. What makes my program unique is that interested developers can easily create their own map packs, so users can always have access to updated or customized maps. This helps avoid the problem of only having the “cookie cutter” maps available, like the US states, countries of Europe, world geography, etc. 5. How did you learn to do all this? Code? Write software? Etc. What do you love about all of it? I got into coding because I had WAY too much time freshman year. I bought a coding manual off Amazon and just spent some free time messing around with my computer. It’s an incredibly rewarding experience when you first connect the dots involving why something behaves the way it does on your computer, or just how complex something like Microsoft Word is. Technology is something we absolutely take for granted, and it’s almost impossible for me to comprehend how someone can use such powerful tools without even a rudimentary understanding of how they work. 6. It was brought up in the article so I will ask…In your opinion, why is learning design thinking important for you and your classmates? I see design thinking as a “jumping off” point for innovation – if you’re someone who wants to make something new but has no idea where to start, the design thinking process makes it very easy to get past the entrepreneur’s equivalent of writer’s block. Nothing, however, can replace dedication and good ideas. 7. How did you practice the principles of design thinking when working on Stephens-Petrochko? The only reason I got started in the first place was because Mr. Stephens was dissatisfied with current software packages, so I met with him and tossed some ideas around. Hence, in the span of a month I pretty much nailed down the empathize, define, and ideate phases. From then on, it was just a matter of spending some pretty long nights in front of the computer debugging line after line of code (what is officially referred to as “prototyping”). 8. Has this been your Academy Scholars Project for three years? How many hours overall do you think it took? Are you still working on it? As I stated before, probably 120-140 hours in its entirety, but I’d estimate probably 80-90 hours of just coding. I’ve kind of put off coding it until the whole college application process dies down, but I plan to start working on it again in the spring. Some of my friends, however, have been pretty eager to test my program out and have found plenty of bugs for me to fix, so I’m eternally grateful for that! 9. What would you like to create next? Right now, I’m pretty interested in low level computing and robotics. I’m planning on working more with hardware over the summer, specifically microcontroller programming with the Arduino microcontroller. 10. Are you pursuing a computer science degree in college or something similar? I plan on getting a degree in computer science or computer engineering, with a possible minor or double major in Entrepreneurship or Business.

anything for my rabbit. and noooo I like you weird
<3
stat
okay babe
haha
and your picture was on the little chat bubble,
and it showed up in the FB window

okay haha!
driveway*
hahaha right?? I had this epiphany like just as I was driving into my drive way
and you'd be amazing at that
because literally I've tried writing a song 100,000,000,000 times but the lyrics are always impossible for me
you write me a poem and I'll put beautiful music to it
we should write a song

your call, m'dear
definitely a Jessie piece
It's really beautiful, by the way
Mine might be worse but it's whatever you think
Hey these are just some mechanical suggestions! I have what you wrote in red, and my suggestion in blue (so deleting all the blue stuff would just be keeping it the same as it was before, and deleting all the red stuff would be accepting all of my changes).

❤️
Okay. HW distraction

I did "Describe a place or environment where you are perfectly content. What do you do or experience there, and why is it meaningful to you?"
Some students have a background or story that is so central to their identity that they believe their application would be incomplete without it. If this sounds like you, then please share your story. Recount an incident or time when you experienced failure. How did it affect you, and what lessons did you learn? Reflect on a time when you challenged a belief or idea. What prompted you to act? Would you make the same decision again? Describe a place or environment where you are perfectly content. What do you do or experience there, and why is it meaningful to you? Discuss an accomplishment or event, formal or informal, that marked your transition from childhood to adulthood within your culture, community, or family.
there's a few you can choose from
hold on
that's often the hardest part
try to think of something to write about though
<3
hey I'll help you with it
did you write your common app essay yet?
otay :D I really like it
for example
Despite the business of my life in my senior year... -> Despite my hectic year...
oh well there are some that seem slightly awkward, but none of them are like grammatically flawed, per se
errors*
haha I couldn't find any erros
i don't think so but i'll double check
That's better than 96.2% of my classmates' writing
Jess this is actually so good!
Sure hon 1 sec
Did I tell you about how I was reading about naked mole rats last night?
Uhm maybe? Show me again when I'm over ;D
You showed me! Iz pretty
Well there ya go :D yours are cooler than mine

haha good girl
dude be all you can be and more
awww good!
be intrigued
haha that's good
same haha
:D
like what did it taste like?
how was the flower?
and I'm done with history
the things that have stressed me out most have been things like history
and it's much better now because I enjoy a lot of my work
yep haha I plan to!
so I gotta never fall back
I do best when I'm running in the front
I have to stay on target or I'll explode Jess
unfortunately I can't afford to be like that now :/
ahh
haha wow I need some of that
literally I'm stressed out right now haha
haha I want to go to Souderton all of the sudden
haha wow
no haha! I'd doubt myself in your place
I'd be freaking in your place
your confidence astounds me
ahahaha
haha I love how unstressed you are
yeah I can tell haha
you can do that for any of them
haha no they're not!
making the study guide actually helps you enough, you don't have to actually study it per se
then one or two days before the assessment, make a study guide for the material
keep up to date on homeworks, making sure you understand everything
so you know where to go for information
keep all your notes super organized
okay this is how I do it
I only study before quizzes and tests haha
hell no
haha have you ever used Quizlet?
you'll literally be unstoppable
dude use Quizlet!!
niceee
hahaha
haha then studying would be difficult
Quizlet has saved my life
I can show you some tips though haha
that prooooobably would just turn into sex
hahahaha
It's not!!!!!
haha I'm telling you my memory is crap! i have to write stuff down
if I just read something, I'm not any different... it just leaves my head
and I practice
honestly with crap like that I take notes
I feel like everything I write is wrong too
hehe well there you go

if you have any questions answer me I can probably explain it better anyway :D
okay go read!
haha you have
it's less than fifty pages haha you can honestly read it in an hour

I don't really know what else I could want
wow the two cutest girls in the world love each other
Haha they probably thought that about you
Haha trust me I have. I love that all my friends liked that pic of you
I'm glad, and obviously Des misses you

oh were you're parents okay with you yesterday btw?
haha okay I better be there
what would I play?? I don't think people would like my music

hmm I do Game of Thrones and Mad Men, and occasionally Simpsons or Family Guy
actually idk haha
and sexual
it's really violent
you should watch it haha
yeah haha it was so captivating
so I went to bed, and then an hour later you woke up
haha I was up till three watching Game of Thrones
have not even left my room today
haha well you're clearly more motivated than I am
haha so you can cook
I need breakfast
that's me haha
haha well I woke up an hour ago
hey how's Jess
Haha np ;) hey I gotta go but text me sometime 610 322 6829
Yo I just gotta say your hair is freaking awesome
True true. I guess I need friends that are more into that sort of thing
Ahh I'm jealous... I need more nature in my life
Wow that's pretty sweet haha what's it like?
Hmm pretty fun, have to work a lot though.
Oh so not that long I guess. What's your summer like?
You've been out like a week right?
Haha yessss I love it!
Looks like fun haha
Ooo hold on
Haha what'd you do
Heyy what are you up to
speaking of which, i'm out haha gnite
like, just an idea
haha dogs solve everything. also you might wanna sleep at some point
ahaha probably is ;) sounds like you need a dog
aww! that's freaky haha. i'm sure you'll be fine
haha it's alright, and i actually live an hour away. what's on your mind?
wow i thought you were asleep haha. Yeah we def should! And my school is... pretty dull actually
Hmm mostly like Kaylies friends and one kid who used to go to my school. I guess you now haha
actually really long story... But basically we met at the Harleysville fair. From what I've seen Souderton people are way nicer than the ones at my school so I tend to gravitate towards them
actually Kaylie was the only one i knew at that party haha
haha i don't know any guys from Souderton really
ooo i won't haha. i was actually super pumped for the pool, but that's what i get for being there late ;D
hey no problem! felt a little out of place haha but much better than any parties at my school
!!
And Shan I didn't know either
Wait Kerr you're not doing senior week?
Kerry :0
Matt you're always welcome at my house. Neema idk after that last comment
:0
Idk what we're talking about but I wanna go camping
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bpr-QQr2f-w
Coming to selin from dport now
Ya my b
Selin 2:30 right?
Hey so I've been waiting in line for a Yale Harvard ticket for like an hour and a half and I have like an hour more to go so ima probably be late
okay perfect, I doubt we need one that badly but it's good to know in case we do
that's fine
alright perfect, do we have filming equipment?
so I think we don't have to turn anything in tomorrow, but we should really try to get some filming in tomorrow. can everyone meet tomorrow after class?
hey so I talked to Professor Stuart, she said "Don't worry about it. Everyone has had difficulties, so we can discuss edits on Tuesday."
Is there anything we can film today?
Hey guys I left Jon Bishop a voicemail asking if we could talk to him about meeting in New Haven, but I think the earliest he could meet would be Wednesday. Is our film due Tuesday?
also, some health expert talking https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqJAeReFr8I
ey we're ready to shoot the intro
Someone tell will, I don't have his number
sweet 10:30 let's do it
will? ali?
Hey all, we need to have a group meeting tonight about housing, can everyone meet some time past 10?
What does will do then?
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags
Haha make sure you include the part where we inadvertently overwrote two hours of networking code then redid it in 22 minutes
Nah they took forever to post winners though so I expected it
really????
is that right????
:D dude http://yhack2014.challengepost.com/ says we get $775/team
The one that overlooks the main entrance
Meet me by stairs we took
Like: https://heatmapforlatitude.appspot.com/static/heatmap.png
So you could see like: "Oh holy crap Veena spends a ridiculous amount of time in Sterling"
another sweet idea: some sort of mobile app that tracks where you (and potentially your friends) are throughout the day, then makes a heatmap based on where you spend your day.
Yo we could definitely use this to our advantage though, like what if we had an application that was largely web-based, but draws on data collected via mobile APIs/geolocation services. Turn our weaknesses into strengths!!
alright will do man
/Matt you could skype in or something
Yale team do you wanna get together tomorrow some time to figure some stuff out and maybe brainstorm a bit?
Or geographically based, like Yik Yak.
The app could be one big graffiti board or let users make their own for themselves/their institution.
Could be combined with other forms of posting, like pictures, gifs, etc. This would incorporate web design stuff, server-side image generation (with any language) and web-server related stuff, so I think everyone would have plenty to do.
Another idea - a grafitti board that lets users post (anonymously or not) to a "board" and upvote/downvote other posts. The top posts are used to create a grafitti board kind of like this: http://1.usa.gov/1wBZd9a
Yeah we both know Java and web development stuff
That's why I feel like it's gonna be easier if we do something web or desktop related
Hmm do you think it's too much of an issue that Veena and I don't have mobile experience?
super straightforward to use, but idk if apps can use GPS in background??
yeah https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/
or hell, any Google API?
has anyone worked with google maps API before?
boom!
so like if it sees two users have the same path 85% of the time, it suggests they carpool
yeah!
Wait nvm that's exactly what you said. I don't think carma does that
What would be sick is if it like, ran in the background or something, analyzed your routes and then like compared them with other people using it to try to get matches
I like it. I found an app called Carma that might be similar, but I'm not sure
Also - key point about idea 1, the background could be specific to whatever keywords are found on the website (i.e Yale.edu would have pictures of Yale's campus in the background, WolframAlpha woud have some cool fractal as the background)
I've messed around with the concept, it's actually surprisingly easy to do and there's a good tutorial here http://bit.ly/1uXVjo4 (chapters 9 and 10)
http://bit.ly/1uXVaku
If you've never seen a genetic neural network simulator, check out these youtube videos:http://bit.ly/1pn4fQg
Second: a Java game/applet/Javascript game where simulated organisms (each with an neural network) evolve to become smarter based on environmental factors. This has been done before, but perhaps we could make it so the player INTERACTS with the organism by inserting obstacles, bits of virtual "DNA", changing environmental factors, etc. in order to meet some sort of end-game goal (get a large enough population, wipe out another organism, migrate all your organisms from point A to point B)
The first: a chrome extension of firefox plugin that basically sets all html "container elements" to transparent and replaces the background of any given website with a static or scrolling image. Examples are: http://bit.ly/1obxdCW http://bit.ly/Zm7QbG or http://bit.ly/1uxJKau

some study packet
Robert said there was a packet
i think
study if you want
true dat
but i didn't get first :0
yessss i did
so i most likely got somewhere from 2nd to honorary mention
they only tell if you placed
so idk yet
category award
i need a way to ask sarah to prom
liz
yoooo
no probs lizzy
and the book too I guess
definitely the powerpoints
wow yeah that was a pretty bad one hehe
haha nonsense
ahaha thanks Liz you too
haha yeah that's also very true
just realized that...
there seems to be a common theme of giant possibly-mystical creatures in all my doodles...
and Helen Gerhold getting eaten by a dragon haha
i also drew one of Robert getting attacked by a giant bird
haha in the last week
*class
haha i have a bit of a problem with doodling in that clas
so probably something with genetic enhancement and GMOs
haha Thursday was devoted to drawing a doodle of a giant cow attacking a farm
I don't pay too much attention in class
i'm not the one to ask haha
I forget actually
*Friday
we didn't do anything Frida

https://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/602549_4632176079052_592155356_n.jpg this came up on my newsfeed
haha i guess
but he'd be insane to not flirt with them haha
i see Katie Tanner and Christina Tornetta sitting next to him in their short skirts and flirting with him all the time!!
haha Doc?
hehe yeah I do. hey girls do it to male teachers...
no but seriously it's weird
HAHA BUT WHO DOESN'T RIGHT????
haha yeah she does sometimes give off the vibe that she wants the D
hugely significant difference
she loves me
no
i know bitch needs to get her facts straight
veeeerrrry ambiguous
a lot of questions were ambiguous
ahh i'm sorry
you?
danke
uhm i think A-?

Sucks I guess...
Post wrestling haha?

it's sweet haha
it literally turns like all different colors
like when the purple onion pigment mixes with the blue
haha right?

haha robert
which was pretty sweet haha
and then we watched it turn rainbow colors
i grabbed methelyne blue and stained the crap out of it
when mrs. dann wasn't watching
haha honestly
but we had a double to do it
it takes like ten minutes...
when everyone's listening to some boring ass presentation you can just chill in the backroom and text while you watch an onion cell shrink

i'll give you a hug if i remember
happy birthday Lizard!

austin and myles both have muscle on me
i think myles might be able to beat me
yeah
and i always escape on him
but we didnt wrestle the third period
he was up by one
yeahh
but he's certainly one of the worse varsity wrestlers
he's better than austin and i
he sucks haha
nope
haha killian's at his weight
if that makes no sense don't worry
he's better in neutral i'm probably better in referees
ahh man we're super close
i feel like i should probably be varsity
haha i am pretty awesome
well i finished my wrestling season with a grand total of 7 losses and 23 wins
hmm
haha yeah i will definitely agree with you
i think there's something wrong with me
haha
so i decided to study
and it felt weird
cuz of no wrestling
i finished my homework earlier
pft
haha studying
hey liz whatsup
haha
the office
heyy liz
yesss it does
i initiate all our convos
she just doesn't talk to me a lot

Matt Millers
yeah postparty

you know i think i do
haha
i thought you were sorry we didnt hu
oh nvm
haha why?
but haha
not really
i appreciate your directness though
nope haha
haha i guess so
hey bud
the reasons for why are between kelsey and me, and yeah i was planning on it before this happened
and i don't think she does
whatever
-.- alright well i don't think so but if kelsey wants to
you're sure on this?
but you're not saying any of this to austin right?
and i don't think so
it's up to kelsey
omg...
alright if its hw related i probably don't know

ok
alright liz tell me next time you're filling austin in on everything i say

oh well no if i told you i'd be a bad friend to austin...
alright when austin can learn to respect girls a little more, and his friends for that matter, ill accept his friend request
oh yeah i have a friend request from him so i def did
i'm pretty sure i unfriended him
hmm?
he thinks im jealous of him because he "gets with so many girls"?

http://www.facebook.com/home.php#!/profile.php?id=1818785879
hii
haha ok
this is the stuff you need to think about for these simulations
haha ok :)
is say that it cant bounce twice within say... 5/55ths of a second
no what i;m gonna do
that its bouncing
itll reduce its speed for every 1/55th of a second
but if it happens to hit the ground for more than one fifty fifth of a second
but if it works out so that
than it slows it down and bounces it
and if it has
it checks to see if its hit the ground
55 times per second
what happens is
cuz basically
haha i know why it happens
itll hit the ground and like sorta flop
sometimes if the framerate works out oddly
theres a glitch though
ill tell you how long it is h/o
hahahaha i won't be able to work on it for a while
his comp lets him see all the comps
i got off like four seconds before
that was funny
xD
oh haha
gtg
but im pretty goo
nm u i have to go at 11 this time for real haha
heyy
bbl!
gtg dinner

i should probably get off facebook anyway
well
oooooookay
i feel dirty just sitting here
well
noooo
and was that an intelligent decision...?
what makes you think i'm not having fun?
at 1:35 in the morning
i'm writing an english essay
i'm having plenty of fun alone
i think i might have to go shower
ick
ewwwwwww
yeah haha that was a weird one

haha i like it, but alright cya
hahaha
mister?
or whatever you do at 10:00 at night
and you should probably go to bed
haha alright well I should do homework
yeah i actually like her too
haha didn't you say the same about Taylor Swift?
like the first one seemed kinda atypical for country genre
haha it's pretty good, i feel like he's kind of like "typical" country
i did haha i think that was the first i looked up
Toby Keith haha
uhm hold on
haha
country music
OH
say what?
probably pretty hard too
ahaha that he's going to bed - man i could tell he was judging me though
although i'm going to have to say this one probably tops it
the song
I find 100 years depressing
aww haha :')
haha nah but i came close when they hugged at the end
probably
would that emasculate me?
hmm
i actually really like that
okay, done
oh haha nah the ":0" was me responding to how sad this is
:0
omg
hehe
good girl
don't rush me
haha i'm watching damnit
aw
awkward
oo wow my dad came in halfway through
IM GOING MORGAN
oo okay found it
haha okay un momento
buuuut i guess i'm going to be listening to country
ahaha wow so i was gonna make pasta
this is your chance to enlighten me Morgue
your absolute favorite
actually what's your favorite
haha what's his best song?
ooo i don't know him
ahaha noooooooow he gets it... nah i went on like a day-long tangent once where i just listened to nothing but country and some of the lyrics are like hilarious
at least from my limited knowledge
haha i guess i can see why you like country though, i think they usually have better lyrics
haha agreed, usually don't get that far though ;D
haha like whenever "Lights" by Ellie Goulding comes on, you can never tell what she's possibly saying so i just kind of make up my own words
haha i guess that's true... ooh like writing lyrics? when in doubt just make up your own
not my strong suit
ahaha jk that's cool! i just kind of half mumble the lyrics when i'm not sure
probably borderline unhealthy
you should get that checked out
wow yeah that's really strange
haha are you good at remembering song lyrics?
ooh that might actually be helpful. i wonder why that actually makes it easier to remember
ahaha it so is, some are soooo bad too
yeah I couldn't really find a good one either, just kinda ended in me perusing weird math songs
oooooh haha awkward
oh haha okay thanks
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBtUetKJzOU ?
Hmm. Do you have your email open?
It's for Docs class so I can pretty much submit it whenever

haha oh shit I forgot Matt
not a shot in hell haha
but like if he doesn't
no I think he is
maybe if Chris does
eeeehhhhhhhh
well, if I do track I'll pole vault
but I figure I'll be checked out come fall
haha who knows, maybe I'll change my mind
I'll watch don't worry
hahaha I've done enough bodily harm to myself in that sport
well that makes one of us
alright cool haha. planning to rekindle polevaulting this spring?
thanks haha, gotta love the hair
yeah yeah she's a gem. so uh I'm kind of relying on you to fill me in on anything in your relationship with Chris because he literally never tells me anything
and I trust you two to be non-judgemental more or less
no haha just made me laugh. she's chill but hasn't really met any of my GA friends
like woooow
eeeeeek
and get yourself in trouble
ooo that awkward moment when you respond to something else
uh hey so like you Chris and my lady and I should hang sometime
so I think I take the gold in that department
nah jk I went to business camp
oh wow geek
sweet how's your summer going too? Chris doesn't really tell me these things

you probably won't
hm alright tell me if you hear from him
he's quite a surprise at times isn't he
wikipedia i guess?
haha that's a good question
which is kind of surprising
well it also has the lowest suicide rate in the world
Haha it's the poorest country in the world
That's like the worst place to visit on earth
and he didn't tell you? wtf that's so weird
Haiti? why the hell would he go to Haiti
wait what?
yo why is chris gone
okeydokes
what time?
Alright do you have a time?
Did he have something in mind
Okay wanna meet up some time?
Sorry sorry distracted
Ahahaha
Wasup brotha
Yep! Tylegitimate
Okay! Thanks Emma you rock
Sweet, thanks Emma
Thanks! Do you know what the attire is?
hey emma do you know when we get back from the naturalization ceremony?
I'm going to be honest if we didn't have physics first thing tomorrow, I would not be coming to school until 10:00 haha
And actually Chris was the one who said he needed your stuff
Cuz Chris had church
Yeah it's actually all good. I'll send you mine soon, I'm doing discussion and error now
yo physics lab?? we need your chunk dude
good
I didn't do any hw
ahh you're correct
do we have a test tomorrow?
goooood. study away Patty
don't think we set a date
i have no idea
ok haha. are you doing the physics lab?
did you do the whole stat packet?
haha
sleep dude
gnite dude
aight goin to bed
works for me
then use that with the kinetic energy from b to find kinetic energy at the inner entrance
then for c you can find the work done by gravity by integrating?
just conservation of energy
i guess the answer to b is super easy
that was gnawing at me
yeah
mistake by Scherrer?
look at it
and C says when its on the inside entrance of the tunnel
B says when it passes the outside entrance of th etunnel
and wait
Actually, I think that only works until you get to the mouth of the tunnel
Oh shit. Misread it. Would you use conservation of energy or integration through the tunnel to solve it?
Wait does it?
Yeah but he said the kinetic energy is the same at both ends of the tunnel
*
Shell+
Atleast one infinitely thin she'll
Yeah, but while it's moving through the little "tunnel" it's always fully outside a shell
How is the answer to b and c the same?
3
and the one's closer to the inside accelerate it towards the center of the shell
because the "shells" further towards the outside don't accelerate it
wouldn't it accelerate while it's going through it?
how can the kinetic energy be the same when it enters that hole and leaves it?
question 3
alright dude one more thing
haha
fuck me
Ug gets bigger up close
moment gets bigger farther away
yeah i've been thinking about it upside down
oh fuck
does it matter that Ug uses the reciprocal ?
moment is based on r^2
that works though, right?
ahahaha you can also do it by turning the whole system about the second particle and thinking of their momenta of inertia
and estimate each's mass based on it's squared difference from the other particle?
each with 1/100th the mass of the other particle
imagine breaking it up into 100 little particles
alright tell me if this is a good way of thinking about all these guys
yeah
damn
but that's like a different line of thinking from the first one
okay I get that too
you'd think when their centers of mass are at the exact same spot, Ug would be zero
how is it possibly the same for all the shell scenarios?
that thinking totally falls apart in comparison to his answer
look at V
and the other stick one
that makes sense for that one
smart dude haha
wow
oh yeah that does make sense
yeah i kinda see that conceptually
yeah i get that
ok
wait fuck i'm confused
down the stick...
as you move away from the particle
so what you're saying is
?
wait what
not force
but dude, keep in mind this is gravitational potential energy
...? when did we even learn that term
isn't the center of mass equally placed between their two centers of mass?
but how does that tell you it's less than -U?
yeah that's true...
like give your reasoning
how do you estimate it?
second one?
honestly, the second one's doable with integration
but yeah I got it
no idea how that makes any sense
spheres are just particles essentially
yeah
aight get it
okay
weird enough that you can't guess them...
and long rods
but like half shells and stuff
and they're not weird per se
one problem
yeah but it's just estimation!
christ
jesus chris
and it's soooooooo hard
is like judging gravitational potential energies of weird shapes
the first part of the quiz
but I don't think it works like that
haha I went there too
hahaha I'm good
who's in it?
damn
physics?
?
can i call you
yo wait
do you know how to calculate the gravitational potential energy of a system that is a particle inside a shell?
like majorly fucking difficult haha
dude it's uber hard
fack
did you do the practice quiz?
no worries
pat
pat pat
yo pat
did you get problem 56 and 58?
damn
I'll check skype
I guess... but he's unreachable atm
or did you guys talk about it?
does he even know what he has to do?
God he's killing me
are you talking to Chris?
aight I'll resend the lab shortly
are you going to?
alright dude I gotta study for stat
yeah... think air rifle
dude he's getting cenile
haha you're a mean one, Mr. Grinch
I know classes that do that
so..?
haha did Anvit do anything wrong?
or at least probation-ized
if it was really that bad
haha tbh I'd imagine Scherrer would get fired
that's literally insane
did they get detention?
shit continue
locks them?
what happened?
no
we good?
I'll look it over
hmm okay
haha how so
I'm going to kill you Patrick
alright cool cool. anything else?
yep
yeah haha that's a math thing
makes it less nasty
I"ll just write substitute in...
ehh
yeah that might be a bad idea
ah okay
tell me if there are any other errors
I'll resend it
idk
aight hold on
or I can do it but I'll have to resend to everybody?
fuck could you add it in?
like a few lines
okay cool, could you double check my theory to see if it makes sense? it's short
how's the lab?
I'll see if there's anything I can do, though
formatting will take ten seconds, plus Davonne is bound to undo all my formatting and make his own
since it's not a massless spring
we have to calculate that motherfucker into it
like hard
well, that sucks
crap I forgot about the grav potential of the spring itself
uh
yeah let's leave it equation
algorithm? tf
the data analysis isn't too complicated right? like easy enough that I could get cracking on it without the theory section
yeah, sounds good
okay cool
it's the Spring lab, right?
I'll probably dedicate most of tomorrow to it, and I don't get back from wrestling until like 7:00 anyway
okay cool
Tonight? Don't kill yourself man
When will it be done by? Data analysis and conclusion can't write until theory
Did you do it already?
yo pat who's doing what for physics?
hmm aight
you think no hw?
we had a test I believe
aight thanks
very helpful bud haha
do you know stat hw?
yeah its the 20th
aight sweet
do we have a stat test tomorrow?
Alright. I think this test won't be too hard
Yeah the book does that, but he goes into isobars and crap
Like damn
Wow holy shit Scherrer is awful at explaining it
Correct?
If the potential energy is U(x,y) at (x,y), then the force vector at (x,y) is -dU/dx units to the right and -dU/dy units up?
Yo I actually got it - they're not that hard
yo bud you around? could use your help with Gradient Operator shenanigans
Yeah I def will! They're all booked for a while though which is annoying
Oh solid, last question but what like format does it use? Some laser cutters take illustrator/Inkscape files I know
Oh solid, where can you buy/get wood from?
How big a sheet can you cut/engrave?
Hey dude are you certified with the laser cutter?
alright, thanks. Final question - do you know anything about the combined BS/MS program through compsci?
yeah dude that'd be sweet, could you?
alright cool, thanks dude
I know the department's super small and I was just curious whether it feels limited at all
what are Yale compsci research opportunities like realistically?
oh you got into Viper! That's pretty cool, that's another great program. I definitely do like that about Yale.
thanks dude! I was actually going to ask you - why did you choose Yale over Penn M&T?
wow i haven't started the homework yet
do we have a physics test tomorrow?
alright cool cool
i have MLA citations for all my Jstor ones just in case
yeah, i guess so
I can probably fill up more than six slides, just so don't feel like we have to stall
alright, i'll fit my stuff into a powerpoint and filter out all the crap
Ey dude I'm not in school this week, can I give you $7 at the party or at prom?
I did 4 and it was a lot of fun, but I think Kate did 6. I think they're both good, and you'll bond a lot either way.
B|
haha I can't wait
Thanks dude, enjoy your summer so much
Especially with TD, STEM majors at Yale, club athletics, or the social scene
If you ever need anything, or are just unsure about something lemme know
TD and Yale are awesome, you'll be so happy there
and people don't get in trouble for drinking, which is nice
The Jewish dining hall serves wine on friday nights, not joking
Also - one of the weirdest things about Yale is that they're super lax about alcohol
I heard insane things from the Oktoberfest party haha
so like Oktoberfest, Chinese New Year, etc.
Haha yeah they're pretty cool. Every cultural house will throw a huge party for whatever their main holiday is
I went to a few vietnamese parties at the end of the year and they were on the smaller side (15-20 people) but really really nice
They are! I think my favorite parties are the cross-cultural mixers
There are also tons of dry/alcohol-free parties, but I haven't really been to many
And they're much more like a normal party, in that there's music, people are chatting, and there's sometimes food
Most of them, even Yale-sponsored ones (believe it or not) will serve alcohol
The rest of the parties are mixers, social events, and dorm/apartment parties, which are WAY more fun in my opinion
But don't get me wrong, they are a LOT of fun to go to with friends, and you'll probably end up going in a huge group of TD freshman to one of these frat parties and having an awesome bonding experience
The main reason people go to frats is for free alcohol and to find people of the opposite sex, which is probably true at any college haha
Some frats are pretty fancy, and will have expensive drinks, but most of them are pretty average and kinda grungy
Frat parties are thrown at huge frat houses usually 15-20 minutes away from the residential colleges
(I def. did)
The main big ones are frat parties, which, if you're like most freshman, you'll spend your first three weeks at basically every weekend
There are a few different types of parties
Hmm, it works like this
At Yale in general?
Which is awesome... because old campus and some other residential colleges will have tons of asian tourists/other students stopping by so you can't really just lounge around in the grass. In TD, people will just sunbathe out on the hammock sometimes
Hmm, people that aren't in TD almost never end up in TD, because it's not along a direct walking path
Where they provide some kind of food, usually chips/pizza/chipotle/barbeque, basically so students don't go out drinking on an empty stomach
Most saturday nights, TD has "study breaks" in there
Plus, a lot of upperclassmen have access, so you can always have one open it for you
any other night you could get away with just going whenever
If you want to organize a thing, you're supposed to reserve it, but people generally only use it on friday and saturday nights
within 3-5 days, you'll have 24 access
If you want to be able to just open the door whenever you want, you have to go to the master's office and fill out a tiny form
So it works like this (most stuff in TD works this way):
We have like this one room that has a huge plasma screen TV, and you can just go down there and watch movies with friends for study breaks
Oh, TD has movie nights occasionally, too
I know, right??
Cabin in the Woods? Ever see that?
you'll love it, then, haha ;D
Yep, haha
It's also super scary because you have to run through this forest for like 25 minutes
They're really fun! They get harder to commit to as the year goes on, but one of the peeps I met on FOOT met her boyfriend that way
So like 6-10 TDers will meet in the courtyard at 11 or midnight, run to east rock (a huge cliff that overlooks all of New Haven), then run back
Yeah haha I've heard that. TD also has a tradition of midnight runs
Those are just the ones that I've played, so idk how popular the rest are
Hmmm...
Inner-tube water polo is pretty popular, but I've never gone
Football, volleyball, ultimate frisbee, and softball are also really popular
In TD, soccer is definitely most popular. For some reason, we had a ton of really good freshman this past year, took first in intramurals, and then went on to play Harvard's winning intramural team (no idea if we won)
Good call. Some intramurals (especially in TD) are like super intense, but most are pretty casual
We won the Tyng this year, and I think we've won way more than any other college
yeah absolutely! Also we always do super well in intramurals, which are a blast if you're into it
But I could definitely rant for hours, as you can tell
Some of the colleges are literally known for having zero pride
Mmhmm! It's definitely the exception rather than the rule, though
And like, out of the 500 people in TD, if you were ever visiting somewhere and needed a place to stay, you could just post in the group and someone nearby would invite you to stay as long as you'd like
TD is amazing. People in the TD fb group are literally buzzing about y'all already ;D
Upperclassmen will also get you anything you're not old enough to buy and will bring you to parties and cool events.
Also, a few upperclassmen bought some tickets to a broadway show but couldn't go, so they gave them out to their underclassmen friends.
My workout buddy is a compsci senior, and next year he's starting his own startup that does athletics-statistics for big sports team, and he's bringing me on as a software engineer
Of course! Another thing about TD is that upperclassmen are always super eager to help out their little sibs. Just a few examples:
if you're interested, it's probably the main comp-sci research lab
http://scazlab.yale.edu/yale-social-robotics-lab-research-projects
Robotics that can talk with people, other robots... Tbh I'm not super knowledgeable but I know it gets a lot of great rep
There's also a really famous lab here that does social robotics
Also, Aerospace actually does have a lot of robotics-like stuff. I think there were two separate rover projects this year
Okay cool. I have one friend who really likes it, but I think it's hit or miss with robotics. Some groups are really dedicated and some wait until the last minute to do everything. Yale always does very well at competitions, though
Like a bunch of people left the project because he was too dull. That's the exception though
But just by random chance, I could not really gel with my project leader
and people are a lot more dedicated
It definitely has twice or even three times the following of any other engineering club
And most people who get into it are REALLY into it
Okay, so, in theory, Aerospace is a lot of fun
I did aerospace this year
Definitely the biggest engineering clubs are Aerospace, Formula One, and Robotics
Yeah, I've heard of that I don't know a ton about it. I think Devon Cody is a mech. engineer, right?
So most health-related internships that you do in any third-world country will very likely be covered by Yale
Oo okay. If you want to travel and go to cool corners of the world, there is an absurd amount of funding for global health related stuff
Also, you're interested in like pre-med and healthcare related stuff, right?
Yep, in the villages they don't even speak Hindi
but there are some pics on fb of me with some kids from one of the villages
But yes, I am! I don't speak Hindi so I'm not super helpful
Haha sorry our internet just came back
Healthworkers can just scan the necklace with a smart phone and it all auto-updates and syncs whenever they have an internet connection.
So basically they built like 1500 of these necklaces for like a dollar each, gave them out in rural villages, and now I'm on the team that's going back to analyze the data and see if it actually works
It's a Yale nonprofit startup that developed a small pendant that can store vaccination records for babies
I'm working with Khushi Baby
haha no worries, it's like 10:38 PM and we're all kinda bored
Because they really have to split their time between their two "families" so it can be exhausting
But anyway, the only issue with TD is that athletes sometimes have a really hard time fitting in
Sorry I'm in India and the power just went out, haha
But if you're in TD, all your upperclassmen friends will always have your back, day and night, and will go way out of their way to help you
If you're on a sports team like Kate, it's usually your teammates
Everyone at Yale should have one solid group of people that will always have their backs
Here's how I see it
Okay! That's actually great news
Haha I could rant for literally an hour about how great it is. I forget, are you an athlete?
Foot is super super fun... I did a four day hike and really enjoyed it. It's nice because when you get there, everyone's super anxious about meeting people and making friends, so it's really easy to meet nice people
^That's pretty rare, but like three out of the seven on my trip were from TD, and the three of us are super tight
I would totally recommend FOOT, I actually met my best friend on it
You have no idea how lucky you are! It's definitely the tightest college
YES
Oh my god seriously?!?!
Sounds good 󾮗
Alright killer - hit me up if you're coming up early, you're totally free to hang with me/in my college
Are you planning on doing bulldog days or coming up before then?
It is dude, it's really whatever you're looking for
Also the same goes for Kate haha
If you have any questions/ want to talk about what life is like here absolutely hit me up!
Hey dude congrats!!! I just heard you got accepted!!!!
I also have a ton of photos from the trip, if you need any
Yep, no worries!
Let me know if you need anything else!
The one thing I remember above all is staying with out hosts... My friend and I stayed with two polish brothers and we spent an entire day exploring krakow and learning funny polish expressions. It also turned out that amber is incredibly cheap in krakow, so we bought tons of it to bring back home for Mother's Day.
Hmm let me think...
I did indeed, it was phenomenal. Why?
Thanks man, I'll see where I end up. It's 2:15 AM here, I'll hit you up when I'm doing more planning
Haha it's an awesome experience to have man, you have no idea how jealous I am
Haha real life man. Are you trying to triple crown eventually?
Damn, that is super ballsy. Are you just taking time off from work or whatever?
That's actually so cool that there's enough stores to do that.
Yeah I've heard that too. Did you literally always buy your food along the way?
From cops or the people picking you up
Haha do you ever get shit for hitching?
Eventually I wanna do that 4-day hike through the smokies
Ahh yeah dog I gotta get out there. I've been in India this summer, but I'm planning two hikes for when I get back
Gotcha. Same length?
Damn. Do people thru hike the same way? Like northbound vs southbound, same time, etc?
Any Grizzlies yet?
Damn, how's the PCT compare to AT?
Also any plans for the PCT?
I think I looked at that. Are there any good hikes in Massachusetts- New York?
forgot to mention I'm going with bae ^
Any suggestions for a specific stretch to do? She hikes a lot more than me so I doubt difficulty will be too much of a factor
Yo, I'm looking to do a four-six day hike in the whites, as per your suggestion
Alright sounds good, thanks mate
and don't wanna get into super ultralight cuz of that
Hmm part of what's also affecting my decision is I'm trying to do some backpacking abroad
Wait what size?
Oh heard good stuff about that too.
wow damn
Oh wow, you think the Exos 58 is too big?
Really?
probs Atmos 65
Yo thoughts on a good pack? I've good stuff about Osprey Exos and Atmos
Yeah agreed, I'll hit you up when I decide what I'm doing
Yeah I kind of figured that. Honestly I would love to take a semester off to do it but it seems pretty difficult for CS majors
She's actually a much more experienced backpacker than I am, but we agreed to not share gear/go together so one of us can always bail
My girlfriend wants to do it too, but we probably wouldn't hike together
ideally Harper's Ferry to Kathadin but that might be too much?
Yo I'm tossing around the idea of doing a big chunk of the AT this summer, do you have any thoughts on doing just the northern half starting in like, May?
yeah actually no worries on sending me stuff, I have like 300+ pics for my presentation
oh yeah I actually already checked it out, the katahdin one at the end is sick
also all my gear I borrowed from my girlfriend's dad so I'll probably get your advice before I buy any gear
ah sweet, if you have any good ones could you email me them?
10-3 is like the best time for classes
I don't
yeah some people like classes later in the day
recommend?*
yeah, on friday I wouldn't reccommend it
haha on what days?
ciao man
Remind me, I'll tell you about it tomorrow or the day after
haha long story, it's actually 3 AM here so I'm about to go to bed
Right now I'm in India working with a startup
Yeah. One of my senior friends is starting a startup next year and I'm developing for him
I also started olympic lifting which is a lot of fun
Yeah, wrestling and Aerospace are my main two extracurriculars, but I'm dropping Aerospace next year and I'm assistant coaching wrestling
Workload or in general?
I would noooot trust anyone in my class with something like lin algebra haha
I think some people do that, but all of my classes I've gotten by just doing my own work and checking with others.
Oh I've never like shared a workload before
Wait for college?
Huh?
Allentown I think
hahaha eyy don't we all
Dude congrats!! Haha doesn't it feel good to be done with all that crap?
haha trust me I know man
at least at that HS in Krakow
dude Polish people are the nicest people in the world
Nah dude don't fret that stuff, I def would've gotten flat out rejected from jhu
hey good luck today man
pce niqs
haha thanks mate, same for you
so I'm like in a different world for a while
killed 'em all
haha I had three in two days
(y) (y)
haha alright I'm out best of luck mate
senioritis is a cruel mistress
yeah no I feel you
yeah happens to best of us
probably curved haha
hmm yeah I get that impression too
you're bio?
haha I have yet to see a college sports game
only thing is Yale's compsci is not doing too well atm haha
haha 100% back*
after having gone here for a year, I 100% your decision
I probably would have chose Harvard over Yale admittedly
probably not, yeah I'm glad I am where I am
I earlied too
Yale haha
I'm pretty happy, you'll be happy too man
I got into one school -.-
dude tell me about it
they seriously hated me
all good schools dude, I got flat out rejected on the spot from Columbia
oh shit dude Columbia's nice
oh damn I'm in NY tomorrow and the day after so yeah probably :/
por que?
yeah man, I'm home the next week
I am indeed, I took multivariable in the fall, and am taking linear algebra now
If you wanna hike you can do it
Like halfway through the semester EVERYONE tried to join us cuz everyone waits till the last minute
Also if you say you're going, people will join
The wrestling team is going, I know
Why not?? Did they say no?
It's pretty lame though
There's something called a first responder which is similar but needs no training
Probs not haha.
Yeah, I hated it but a lot of people love it
Yup haha
7 hr/day
I did the second, and it's like school for four weeks
There's a long track that you do once a week for a few months, and a short track where you do 5 full days a week for four weeks
Haha push through matie
They're chill here haha
Yale cops are chill
Haha yeah, but tbh they wouldn't have gotten us in trouble
New haven is a death trap
Haha all at Yale, I never go I to new haven
Runins*
Ingalls rink it's called, that was one of the cop run-one
Oh and I got to literally climb ontop of this giant ice rink that's shaped like a whale
Hmm my college got to go to a llama farm and spend a day playing volleyball and swimming and crap, which was hella fun
Haha yeah my friends and I had to run from cops twice, we saw like 100 people streaking naked through the library, I got to take this sweet ferry for a wrestling thing,
I went crazy the first month but since then I've found a lot of cool stuff that I never got to try in highschool
I know that's generic to say but it's not just parties and stuff
Dude you will literally have the best time of your life man
Why you ask?
Haha it's whatever you make of it
Who's Allie?
Allie?
Hey bud did you end up applying early? / did anyone from GA this year?
Feel free to text/call/message any time
Yeah absolutely man, my num is 610 322 6839
Haha sweet, can't wait
Peace
They all do, but for all colleges but TD and Silliman, frosh don't get to live there >:D
Tight*
It's super right
We have our own green
Nope, old campus sucks
Timothy dwight!!! Best college there is, and a lot of non-TDers agree haha
Haha what'd you like?
Tour*
If you want a dorms your though hit me up man
Oh alright. Are you meeting Dev? Honestly I've been here a week so he'll know a lot more haha
Actually do you wanna have devin tour you now and maybe stop by later? I don't know Dev that well tbh
I'm just leaving my college should I pick meet you on the corner still?
Idk where that is haha
Yep np, I'll show you my dorm and stuff
Okay, I need to get an installation going, I'll leave in like five
Yeah I can give you a quick look in a sec. Where are you?
what topics are you thinking about?
in it*
like you can't really switch INTO engineering unless you want a BA init
mmhmm. word to the wise though, with engineering it's a good idea to board the train early
quite possibly computer science good sir, but there is a lot of room to change
honestly, they're both great schools and chances are you'll have a pretty similar experience at both
it's mindblowing, I know you would definitely love it
Yale is an absolutely incredible place
oh sweet! You excited?
Matt and I went out to dinner but not really. One year they did and got it revoked cuz they got busted drinking
Haha thanks man, you earned it
Add me <('-')>
Oh sweet definitely go for it. And yeah absolutely cool with it, my girlfriends vegetarian and got me into the whole nutrition thing
College staple haha
I'm bringing tons of oatmeal though haha
Yeah sounds pretty similar to me haha, although I stopped eating red meat like a year ago
Yeah it is, weird question but what kinda food do you normally eat?
It's the same size as the Yale ones you can't rent but it feels enormous haha
Dude our fridge is awesome
One for the common room?
Very solid, should I still bring both mine?
You excited dude? Also I have two extension cords with 6 plugs each, does that work? Like are you bringing any?
Ahahaha
Ha okay maybe I'll get someone else to
Haha hell noooo I'm not going to be the guy that posted the Gilmore girls thing on the Yale page
Haha my girlfriend showed me this, was gonna post it in the Class of 18 page but I got nervous.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZpdk6O5s_Y
Haha sweet. Alright dude I'm getting clothes atm, feel free to message me at any time
Ok cool cool. Excited? 1 week man
What are you doing for other decorations? I have like a highschool pride foam finger but I'm gonna start looking for posters soon
Oh haha. Yeah there's really only one model people ever get for dorm rooms I feel.
Nah it's just set up in my guest bedroom, should I? I could buy another at Walmart probs
Alright cool cool. Two each is like 40 feet of strand, so that should be enough to deck out the room
Haha I have no idea. What do you have in the way of blue lights?
Yeah I have two strands, should I get more?
Looks good, right??

Yeah hopefully.
Haha if it fits in an omelette pretty much
You cook?
Sweeeeet
Cuz we're not on old campus
Hahaha may she indeed. We have a kitchen in our building probs, right?
I like the dedicated freezer. It's a nice spin haha
Oh don't worry aalllllll ours mate 😈
3.3 cubic feet, fits yale specifications, mmmmm mm we good
Damn we got ourselves a niiice lil fridge

I'll test them and if they seem I'll prob buy more
use*
it says they're safe for indoor ue
alright sweet bought em
she'd know this stuff
I know, it's bad haha. http://www.amazon.com/White-Christmas-Lights-Clear-Wire/dp/B00336V9IA thinking about these lemme ask my mom though
hmm
isn't like incandescent the broader term for lights that include halogen?
to be honest I'm not sure what the difference between halogen and incandescent is
lemme check
that could very well be
are they incandescent? I think Yale prohibits them
and yeah I'm getting a fridge today so that works
literally my mind was just blown
Dude that's a freaking fantastic idea
B|
alright will do man
Yeah I feel you. Just wait. It'll hit you like a hurricane
and then like boom, 1 month to go and it all just hits
like until that point, I honestly felt kinda weird wearing a Yale shirt even
It like just hit me a week ago
hahaha dude no sweat, I'm just finally getting excited on this whole dorm room front
Yeah haha I'm pretty invested in this so far, legit made a huge bedbathbeyond run the other day
Also is there anything else you want to pimp our room? probably making a home depot run today
one sec
Yeah def, I'll do it.
I know if we ever end up with a TV in our room that'd be the end of me haha
I don't watch TV either really, I'd say leave it up to Ali and Elijah. I'd be more than happy without one
I'm also getting some white christmas lights so we can pizazz up our room
alright solid, how do you want to split it up?
So between the two of us do you think we should have 1 microwave and 1 fridge? or 2 fridges?
Yeah, exactly. Alright dude peace out, I'm waking up pretty early tomorrow.
Haha yeah that's about where I am, They both seem pretty cool
I know Elijah wants to be an astrophysics major
Ah radical. Sounds good my friend, sounds good. Do you know anything much about Elijah and Ali?
Hbu?
University of Maine! Off to study wolves and lobsters she goes
Yeah dude that's actually solid. Mine's gonna be in Maine so I'm pretty much isolated.
But I figure we both have ladies already so we won't need to really worry about it
Haha sweet, I have one too. I asked my bro for college advice and he mentioned that there has to be good communication with the roommate on the lady front haha.
Yeah, and you have a girlfriend right?
Yeah, phew same exact thoughts here.
Yeah I totally agree, that sounds good
Hey man, just in case we end up roommates, what are your thoughts on the whole dorm etiquette/party/drinking thing? I figured someone would need to broach the topic eventually haha
good chat though dude, can't wait to meet you
oh alright I feel yah. alright dude I'm actually at work I should prob get back to that
yeah that could be. Did you do a senior project?
yep Germantown Academy
our school is kinda weird; seniors take off once done their last AP and spend 3-5 weeks doing a "senior project" which is usually an internship or work experience, but we wanted to go hiking instead
other than that I've actually never gone hiking
I did 150 miles for my senior project on the Appalachian Trail with seven of my best buds. No joke it was the best two weeks of my life
yeah absolutely, have you done much hiking before/anything on the AT?
I signed up for Vermont too and got thrown in Connecticut/NY AT haha
wait really? NY/Connecticut appalachian trail?
yeah, exactly. If I find a more casual one I might do it. Are you doing FOOT?
yep! I went for the last two days, so I missed the big performance thing on the first day. There was like a cultural showcase on the second day with a few a cappella performances, but didn't see any that really jump out. The a cappella groups are pretty intense for the most part, correct? like fraternities almost
oh alright solid. I'm a wrestler, which actually works out pretty well because Yale only has club wrestling and I'd get annihilated on a d1 team. As for music I play/ teach piano and sing in my school chorus, not sure yet if I'm gonna pursue either of them yet either. Major-wise I'm thinking computer science for now but am kinda toying with the idea of economics or mechanical engineering too. I know, pretty different topics haha but we'll see what happens
that's actually fascinating, I always wish I'd had the opportunity to take philosophy in HS or at least be more educated on the topic. I was planning on taking philosophy freshman year of HS with my favorite teacher but he literally left that year and they got rid of the class
yeah good idea. so what about you? sports/music/thoughts on a major?
oh yeah makes sense now. aight I friended him, still no luck with Elijah though
oh wow does his fb page display oddly to you?
https://www.facebook.com/ali.shawar2?fref=ts hmm this one?
nope, is Ali's name the same on fb? couldn't find him either
hey man we're roommates right? I tried to find you on fb earlier but couldn't find you haha
Hmm I think Andrew was going to try to arrange a Skype sesh, not sure on the status of that though
hey man, excited to finally meet you. can't wait to hear what your interests/thoughts on a major are
you too man, best of luck
I might have to hit you up for that at some point
Oh damn I just got into soccer
Dude You should've seen me frosh/sophomore year
any sports? tennis man, correct?
Kidding but that'd be sick
Why you thinking about coming out haha?
yeah dude definitely. I started training again yesterday with my highschool captain
that's her haha. boom.
the redhead wasn't at the orientation I believe
(Veena Advani)
yeah and oddly enough my best friend from elementary school too, Veena
Kate Horvat (super super tall/jacked/blonde crew recruit) and cooper hall (pretty attractive redhead lax recruit)
two believe it or not haha
and GA my friend
Yeah psh who wants a lavishly adorned and modernized eatery? hah not me am I right?
yeah I think we have a recording studio? not sure but sounds promising
I guess no Old Campus for me haha
I'm Timothy Dwight
hey dude I never realized you decided on Yale, congrats on the best decision of your life ;D
Hmm there are no clubs or anything I gather?
Is there any gamedev community at Yale?
like a mirror haha. just using it in BestBuy was literally unbearable
I nixed the inspiron 7000 cuz it was absurdly reflective
yeah I was the same way
are you a glossy or matte screen fan?
dumbass.
well I think he poured beer on it or something
inspiron 5000 he hates it
ahaha it's a Dell so pretty terrible things
and he's a rising senior
he said he's needed it 3 times in college
haha idk, my bro uses it all the time he recommended it
so with tax and all mine actually came to like 1100
but my mom insisted upon a 3-year accidental damage warranty
(cheapest y50)
still $300 more expensive than mine
http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/lenovo/y-series/y50/
actually there are a few in the 1100 region
I think all the y50s are backlit, y40s aren't
yep
but that starts at like 1400 with worse specs, so it would have run me up twice as much
yeah if I wanted that I would have gone with the y50, which also has a backlit keyboard
for 800 that's freaking sick
sick right? haha
specs on mine are 8GB Ram, 256 GB SSD, AMD Radeon R9 2GB vidcard, i7 processor
both of which I'm more than fine with
haha only downsides are battery life (I hear anything from 3.5 to 5 hours average) and not a touch-screen display
it's got the screen I want, and it's 14" so fairly portable
it's got the best specs for under 1,000
like you recommended it, two other Yalies recommended it, I went to BestBuy and the guy there recommended it
btw, ordered the Y40
http://its.yale.edu/software-technology/buying-guide/buying-laptops-and-desktops/student-recommendations/where-buy-stude
yo do you know anything about Yale's partnership with Lenovo? it says they have lenovo people at yale that'll repair under-warranty lenovos, but they don't say which warranty option
solid, haha thanks
wait nvm all the ones I'm looking at have it
do we def. need an ethernet port on our laptop?
alright thanks again mate
hmm, it is a possibility
ahh so many choices
good point
yeah I probably wouldn't use the touchscreen
hmm lots of space
you think a dell will be?
like everyone hates the newest clickpad, they say it's horrible
and as for the T440, it got kind of mediocre reviews
Yeah that's true, but it seems like kind of a waste for all that graphics/speed capabilities
hmm the Y50 seems primarily for gaming
which has its own downsides
I know Lenovo's not bad, but the Lenovo I'd want would be the T440s
hmm why do you say that? If I drop it I'm f'ed
granted after 7 years
in case I drop it? haha happened to my last one
so it's like 1200 with tax
oh sorry, tbh I'm getting a 4 year warranty on that
well that one's 849
like XPS is too much, same with HP spectre
hmm I think that's about the max I would pay for one
graphics card is okay, but I'm not huge on gaming
1 TB hard drive, 8 GB ram, i7 processor,
specs are pretty good
gets pretty solid reviews, little worried about the arrow keys
thoughts? http://www.dell.com/us/p/inspiron-15-7537/pd?oc=dncwb1808b&model_id=inspiron-15-7537
alright sweet, thanks!
aight dude I'm at work haha I should probably go do something productive, I'll message you if I have other comp questions
thats awesome
yeah I feel you, sick discounts
yeah he's hardcore haha
haha check out my gaming bud's account http://www.mysteamgauge.com/account?username=coldblood
TF fan?
yeah you can't play it for more than an hour
if not check that shit out
also have you played The Stanley Parable yet?
haha why not
haha epic, what's your comp game of choice?
ahaha I am a pretty big Super Smash bros fan
World of Warcraft took a pretty large toll
haha honestly I used to be a huge gamer but I tried to free myself of it
hmm I game pretty rarely
yeah definitely, whatcha think?
and ideally sub-$1,000
hmm well I'm prospective compsci major, always used a Dell (stone-age, Windows 7/Vista)
Hey man, saw your comment - what are your thoughts on which model to get?
http://its.yale.edu/software-technology/buying-guide/buying-laptops-and-desktops/student-recommendations/where-buy-stude says that they'll repair under warranty lenovos
thanks man, do you know anything about how the repair service works with Lenovo at yale?
hey man not to bother but do you have any thoughts on Lenovo? everyone seems to recommend them
thanks!
alright sweet! I'll weigh my options
I just wanted to know of you had any thoughts on using a tablet at all
With purchase over 699
Alright sweet, and also dell gives you a free tablet if you're a student, any thoughts on that?
Both i7 right?
Any thoughts on i5 vs i7?
Hmm price range is probably sub-1,000 but I'm fine going a little over. Skill level- not really a hardware guy and mostly web/desktop app development stuff so nothing super low-level as of yet
Hey do you have a recommendation for a good comp for next year? Prospective compsci major, not really a hardcore gamer, always used Dell. I was thinking one of these http://www.dell.com/us/eep/p/student-purchase-program-deals#!dlpgid=student-laptops
haha good call, big gamer?
it also probably looks the coolest
yeah the razor is sweet and I've heard a lot of good things about it
it's literally perfect
if I could get any laptop it'd definitely be the current xps 15
still runs like a champ, but I'm not quite willing to spend as much on a laptop
an XPS 15, which I got about 8 years ago when Vista just came out
yeah I've read all the reviews, I just didn't like the screen when I saw it in bestbuy
yeah I've seen that
and right now I'm kind of thinking Lenovo Y40 or Y410P, Lenovo U530, or Dell 15 7000
so mostly compsci stuff, and occasional light gaming/modeling
price range 800-1000 ish
prospective CS major, looking for 14"/15" screen (preferably 1080p and not glare-y) for occasional graphics-card usage (occasional light gaming or modeling software)
hey dude I saw that you recommended to get the Lenovo ideapad, is there a specific model you'd recommend? Specifically, any thoughts on the U530?
yeah I know haha
alright man thanks!
thanks though
I'm going today so we'll see what happens
I gotta try em out at best buy
hmm okay
also u530 has antiglare
also because it's so new there aren't any reviews for it yet, which kinda scares me
1366x768 though, ick
also the most souped up version of the u530 is only 819 with yale discount
hmm what?
alright
http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/lenovo/u-series/u530-touch/?sb=:000001C9:00010C37:
yeah I know, but like check this out
**the
8the
yeah I'm down to the U530, yhe Y40, and the Dell 15 7000
I gotta try it out at Bestbuy
hmm
yeah doesn't really worry me tbh
that is a solid point I suppose
I would actually probably get the y40 if anything, but it feels like a waste because it seems to be primarily a gaming laptop
to make it more confusing there's also a thinkpad yoga, which is different from the yoga I believe
nah they're diff, yoga is exclusively the convertible ones
like it?
did you have the y50?
prospective compsci major* i guess
so I'm a compsci major, probably with light to no gaming, possible CAD usage at some point, and aiming for under 1000 (but 1100-1200 is okay if necessary)
sorry my b
yessssiree haha
hey dude, I saw you recommended the Lenovo IdeaPad, any thoughts on a paticular model? I was looking at the U530
probably gonna opt for the y40 though
aight solid, I'm gonna make a BestBuy run soon to check it out
yeah, also battery life is like 3.5 hours
yeah the 410p looks pretty sick
so I'm a prospective compsci major, probably occasional gaming and perhaps some CAD use, and aiming to get in the 800-1000 price range
hey dude, I saw what you said about the Lenovo IdeaPad (I'm thinking about getting one for next year). do you have a fav paticular model? I was thinking maybe the u530
hey man, for the fridge, would I have to drive up and get it? incoming freshman here
Hey Susan, about the fridge - would I have to come up and purchase it? incoming freshman here
^aka highest rated answer on StackOverflow to date, I believe
look at the first answer :D
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags/1732454#1732454
haha just on the subject of parsing
node is sweet I hear
Haha you would like this, hold on...
Ah that's pretty cool.
Any particular framework/language interest you specifically?
Oh sweet, sounds cool.
Solid choice, what's your compsci background?
Solid solid, my brother's doing biomed at Lehigh he loves it.
What are your options if you don't mind me asking? Because I'm not 100%
Pretty sure, are you CS?
That's some solid advice though, many thanks.
That def needs work haha, haven't done much since soph year
And some game design with Unity3D of course haha
Using Ruby-on-rails/Bootstrap
and this summer I've been building a web app that handles new-employee onboarding for this company http://bit.ly/1ssAgZC
soph year I did a research project where I built an array-based data structure, kind of like an AVL tree but stored as 2-dimensional array
basically a geography-teaching program, just something I did for school credit haha
spgeography.weebly.com = 3-year java application with JavaFX
But nah that's sweet.
Ahhh gotcha. I've toyed with the idea of doing that...
Oh voxel-based?
That's pretty absurd haha.
He designed a game engine??? Damn.
Is he an all-around compsci wizard or just a very talented web developer?
Oh wow haha, kid must be a genius.
What year did he do his?
Hmm I guess dumb question, never mind. Did you intern with fb?
Oh solid, do most companies make it easy to apply for internships?
Oh ok.
Yes, incoming freshman.
Oh sweet, how would one go about pursuing such an internship for next summer?
Hey Tony, did you post something in class of 2018 about internships at facebook?
Hmm I wondered that myself. I bet if you're a member of the Vanderbilt family there's a lot of publicity and people probably expect you to go there
Haha fun fact Anderson Cooper is a Vanderbilt descendant and went to yale. Learned that last night and was pretty excited
Call me weird but I can def see the appeal of the show
this one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZpdk6O5s_Y

git push origin name_of_your_branch
then
git commit -m "write your commit message here..."
then:
then do git add --all when you're done making changes
(make some changes, idk what you're doing)
git checkout -b name_your_branch
ok this is probably what you want:
have you made any changes yet?
crap I gotta go in a sec
type git status for me
Okay, type in git branch for me
?
Do you have a local copy of the repo on your machine
Okay, dope
?
hmm you're a contributor, right
yeah what'sup man
you too homeslice, no more fights man
damn what'd you do??
yeah, kind of a compliment imho
that's kinda cool actually
in Bangalore... damn
haha
you guys got in a fight? jesus Abhi
destroyed what?
Wow, hahahaha that beats my story
hahaha what happened
:D
haha super
Haha, oh so we're on the same front
?
Yeah, why
I got it when the 5 first came out, so it was getting kinda old
haha, nah all good
yeah, haha
yeah
it was in my backpack, i'm like 90% sure
Idk, I might have left it on the train, at the station, got robbed
yeeeeep
nahhh what happened to me that night
yeah dude, kinda wish I knew more
so that was an experience
woke up at 6:30 AM going the complete opposite direction, with no cellphone
fell asleep on the train
also I got kinda trashed at one called Suicide Circus
I hit like 4 of the 10 really good Berlin clubs
Germany is nice but kinda boring tbh
daaang dude it's good to go home
yes yes true my man
I knowww man I know
/cause and solution to every problem
haha jk can't live withem can't live withoutem
girls man
yeahh yeah I get that
ah gotcha
lololol
in her boobies
so she tried to drown you
hahaha
goteeeeeem
and then you were grinded on by a sexy american lady
and what happened?
hahaha these women weren't really exotic either... all good
Yeahhh haha it's a self esteem booster on one level, but on the other it's totally a killer
Nope
in a Berliner club :(
Same exact thing happened with some British girls, too, actually
which they probably were
if I were trying to get laid
admittedly in their position I'd do the same
haha hell hath no fury man
never came back
"we're going for some air..."
yeeeep pretty much
they left us
...
haha
and then they left us Abhi
...
so like, of course we're like naah
and for a while they were trying to like, daaance dance with us
Spinelli and I were dancing in a little circle with these two girls for like, an hour or two
anyway
(not as sexy as my lady, i must say, though)
Spinelli and I met them in a bar, then went to a club after and saw them there
from Scottland
literally... two of the most beautiful girls I've ever met...
Yeah. These two girls...
Ask Spinelli about the scottish girls
Also... in the foreign club... jesus
Yeah
I was like, damn Tyty you a dumbass sometimes
Haha no, they posted that the day I met them.. came up on fb
yeeeep
yeeeeep
idk where the other two are
the spanish girls
https://instagram.com/p/44uYF6ArNz/
I actually met like a group of like 8 sexy spanish girls, and they invited me out clubbing 0.0
yep, sooo many spanish travelers in Berlin
probably more spanish people than german, tbh
I actually met a tooooon of spanish people
yeah, met a lot of spanish people, though, and they said it's more mainstream too
I think France might be minimalist techno too, idk though
same with Australia/Ireland
I met a lot of london people in the clubs, they all told me it's more mainstream there
London's a bit more mainstream
everyone's super super hopped up on drugs
nope it's always like that
there's one club called Adagio, though, that's pretty dope
all the music they listen takes some getting used to
or "jake the rapper"
Yeah, also google "minimalist techno"
The only super crazy one was a club that's mainly for foreigners that Spinelli and I went to one time
So it's kinda go, dance, get in the groove, maybe take a break and talk to some people, then dance some more, get drinks, etc.
Plus, it's much more about which DJ is there, and listening to music, and doing drugs, then "partying" and/or meeting people
So it's not "crazy", since they can all handle their shit
Hmm, you have to keep in mind these Berliners have been clubbing since they were sixteen
like 100% different from what I thought
Haha, they're not at all what you'd expect
haha, they do get old after a while
Yeah but now it's just beer and clubs :(
first few days were like all fitness classes
Yessss
Haha very very interesting
Haha yeah
That's pretty insane
Damn dude
Viva la bulk
Haha go for it, work it man
Hahaha I know, it's like the vegetarian thing but reverses
Haha haven't yet
Great odyssey article btw
17th I think
But idk if you need "origin/"
Then git pull
I think git checkout -b origin/adding_static_branches
It's with git checkout -b I forget exactly
Google "git how to copy foreign branch"
Haha it's exhausting, and yeah sure wassup?
What was the name of that bar we heard about in Udaipur? Sanjana asked
Haha it's a wonderful and crazy place. I don't like it quite as much as India but it's chill in its own way
Yah hahaha
Fuck, you done it Ruchit
Munich haha. Boarding now for Berlin, ttyl dude
Yeah dude same! How's Bangalore? When you leave?
Tomorrow 8:45 pm
or just e-ticket
Did you have to print your boarding pass before you went to the Udaipur airport?
at their thing
haha gone
it's pretty funny haha, good back-and-forth
and she always says he's making the stories up as he goes
like he caught a turtle and roasted it and ate it
hahaha yeah he's always telling these stories about crazy shit he does in his city
and Yes 100% my friend
I could actually see it, she def flirts with him
Not too awkward
Haha nah it's actually a lot of fun
Haha don't think so
Emphasize period
Thank you.
hehe young love
He FB messaged her saying she's pretty
Alam's mad crushin' on Columbia ;D
Hehe thanks bae <3 sounds like my convo with bae
Namaste brother. What's the change? Local vs CDN?
Haha tell him that
Haha they told me to tell you to submit a new PR
Eh just hold on to it until you're back, I guess. I doubt it'll get here in time (or at all)
Do we have a mailbox here even?
Okay, haha
Yo dude, any way you accidentally took a back iPhone charging cord with you? It looks identical to the one you use to charge your galaxy
ridiculous*
Oh wow that's pretty rediculous
do they say how much they're paying?
Yeah that is pretty dope. If I have time I'll def apply
Np, the one I'm referring to is the UI/UX 3-6 month design internship
You should check this out, someone posted it in Jobs and Internships and looks like your thing. Idk if it's a during-the-year thing though.

Yeah it's pretty good, not too difficult. How's the fb thing?
Oh we will, we will. What are you doing until I get there?
Oh okay good, good. Yo there are some sick temples and stuff nearby though, we gotta visit em all
Haha that scary?
Oh sweet.
Without the auto or whatev
That's good, that's good. If we wanted could we go into the city together?
that's like 2 miles
Oh okay, that's actually not bad
/the main part
Really? Like a few miles away from Udaipur?
Like is the apartment in Udaipur or just outside it? Like can you get to the main parts/waterfront from our place?
Also how far is Udaipur haha?
Hmm. Is the internet in Udaipur good?
Really?
No internet at all? Did you guys get portable routers?

Woah damn, I actually like it.
:D :D :D
WOAH
HOLY SHIT
Really?! Like Beehive beehive? Not a hornet's nest?
Haha I'm so not ready...
Haha wow, yeah that's rough
Yeah? How so?
Figure it all out?
yo are you buying a phone in the US or in India?
That's what I did and she was really helpful, plus there are lots of other people working on hw1 in there too
I'd get there early btw, I had to wait like half an hour, cuz there were people in the queue before me
Tonight
7-9 there are help hours and like 9-11 too
Across from that room there's like an "open zoo" with a bunch of people and open computers that aren't closed off, and there's instructions on who to talk to
Don't go in that room
Yeah so you know where we were when we submitted hw0?
Hmm I'd go to help hours at the zoo, they're hella helpful
Which prob?
ciao
haha no worries, alright I'm out forreal
and good luck with that as well
haha yeah true that
haha alright good luck man
yeeeeaaaah
which calls the second one
that's the first one
haha yeah takes a while
the first basically calls the second, and gives it a tally of 0 to start the process
well the second function is recursive and takes a number and a tally
I used two functions yo
yeah it's an ass
prob 2*
btw I finally fuckin did prob 3
haha didn't even respond yet
^ then I looked back at it and thought holy fuck what a weird language
me explaining racket to my friend: so if you define a function, you use the define function with the first parameter being a list where the first parameter is the name of the function and the rest of the parameters are the parameters of the function to be created, and the rest of the parameters of the define function are all the instructions to be carried out when the created function is executed
adios amigo
but peace out dude
quiz tomorrow
haha German man
haha yeah I know
and now it blows
yeah that was nice
I know man
all too real
nah dude haha it's pretty real
in God knows where
then lunch and relaxation, then Perspectives on Science and Engineering
then up to Science hill (in 15 minutes)
then have to go to LC
I start on Hillhouse,
yep
yeah and I have to go back and forth across campus all day tomorrow.
haha no worries my friend
yeah I searched for "CASM Staff" and a bunch popped up
and searched, like, I think it was CASM Staff?
didn't work for me either, I went to like Yale Library home webpage
?
Math 120, what about you>
didn't work
me too my friend, me too
yeah it's rough
haha I wish I have math before
and idk anyone else :/
not as bad as the android class though
haha trust me bro we're all lost
yeah hbu?
all the homeworks are 100 points and this one's 20
yep. haha.
I know it's pretty cool haha
it work?
run
then type in the little command window "(euros-to-dollars 4 5)" it'll give you an output
ohh yeah so like if you hit the green button
yeah I think it's like either View or Window then "Show Interactions"
took me a while to find it
it's like "Show interactions" i think?
in the toolbar at the top
hmm I think it's in like "view"
like you run it and test the functions in the little second window
you know you can test with the terminal?
haha gotta love 'em
dude uncompiled languages
yep haha
no idea if you can reassign it to a number though
so like you can just say (define a "hello") and it automatically makes variable "a" a string
it's like javascript haha
yeah I think racket doesn't require you to declare variable types
ohh
what's the second one?
most definitely man, it's gonna be an adventure
that's some hard core parentheses shit
the recursion we did in class yesterday was cool though haha
haha nahh, German's kinda fuckin me but otherwise I'm good
I just named my inputs differently but yeah same thing
nah that's exactly what I did
it's all automated so I doubt they physically check the code
I think I named my inputs like "currency" and "exchange rate"?
Like I specified them
Yeah I put inputs in just in case they try to put like, three inputs in
Yeah lets do it haha. I'm makin a trip tomorrow or Saturday, and the "hours" one? Or the conversion one?
Also did you do CS hw yet? Like submit it?
Go for it my friend

ehh you could probs go
that makes sense
oh gotcha
??
period +
aw why awful?

(0.0)
so boom
I think it's like mainly CO2 in there
Uhmm I think it was the chemicals
idk, I think the chemicals set off another alarm
but we pointed out the fact that A) there's not a place on the wall for it and B) when we arrived here it was kept on the ground
they were pissed at us for leaving the fire extinguisher on the ground
nooo no one we know got in trouble minus Will
and it's still in there
and whoever did it hid the fire extinguisher in Maggie's room
I have no idea yet :/
yeah pretty much
yeah they're pretty fucked too
they made like everyone from the party come BACK to TD
but I went to bed at like 4:30 and they were still chewing him out
and uhm I have no idea where he is now
they poured out all the alcohol
uhm not really, they said it would destroy electronics but all mine are fine atleast
with Elijah
nah slept with some frocos from F
there's like white dust over everything
(and it was in the bathroom)
even now
so like
that smelled like death
flooded the entire G tower with this thick gas
and the chemicals inside of it
or like broke one
nooo someone dropped a fire extinguisher
= chemicals everywhere
+ fire extinguisher
drunk antics
so basically
oh God no
no no no
nooooo
yeah do you know what set it off?
and they said if they don't figure out who did it he's 100% responsible
because it was his party
Maceurin?
and Dean Mceurin
yeah so Will got gangbanged by a whole bunch of firemen
really?
why?
thanks for that
(y)
MARTHA

Thursdays*
depends on the week really but most Wednesdays work
let's try to get a good one in when we get back
ey no one else can go tonight :/ so I think I'm gonna get some shit done for now
😊
Haha I can

surprisingly
me too
thanks dawg
i'll let you know when I'm in da US
anyway turkish food calls
plus vietnamese noodle boxes
haha, yeah but falafel and halloumi are everywhere too
i.e. lahmacun
maybe harder as a tourist
Haha, about the same as the US i'd say
so I hate it and go home!?
Haha why
Abhi's not vegetarian and he ate meat only once
Haha zero meat
Before India was a great idea for me
Find your time dawg.
Haha, I feel that bro. Time's gotta be right.
Thank you, Spinelli
originally - not so haha
which is why the "myplate recommendation" includes meat
plus, the USDA gets a shit ton of funding from red meat producers
as is true with the red meat industry, as well
idk, it's a really hard topic to research because there's a lot of money in spreading false info
meaning it's accidently caught, meaning other fish were accidently caught, i.e. turtles/dolphins/mermaids
Hmm, the issue is that a lot of fish is caught bycatch, though
hmm again, depends who you ask
idk ethically wise
healthwise,
haha that's bad dawg
yeah that depends on the fish, though
I'm thinking about ditching fish, recently
yeah, so it's not hard
for like a month, maybe
you should think about cutting out red meat dawg
sooo so so many ways haha
it's just so bad in so many ways
at least red meat
haha idk, i think some day we'll stop eating meat, to be honest
yeah, true that
doesn't matter
haha I know, right?
you gotta admit it's a sound argument for not eating pigs
haha
def
they're super smart fuckin animals
also I think pigs can have friends
oh wow
dat's fucked up
that would really suck
they do that!?
i forgot you're the pig whisperer
like damn that blows, right?
seeing your friends get speared through the face with a spike
like, imagine waiting in line
I ate the skin of some animal that was brutally slaughtered while his friends watched...
lolol
who the fuck makes "pizza and a salad" not vegetarian. RIGHT??
turkish pizza
:(
fyi lahmacun is not vegetarian
anyway, I think I'm going to go and get one last bout of dirty turkish food before I go back home
haha i can never tell sarcasm with you
find Alden a stripper
idk, go to bars, clubs
their red light district is world famous, you should check it out with Alden
I was only there for like six hours
idk cuz why not
I was there yesterday
ooo okay
thursdays def
suicide circus is
maybe thursdays, idk
cocktails and stuff
just kinda watching
there were a lot of people drinking
Total mix
but the music is all like toads/matrix style stuff, maybe a little more recent and remixed
like 20s and 30s mostly
but people are older
It's way more upscale
Yeah on a Saturday
yeah... and if you're gonna go to adagio, def go with friends
honestly super similar to sisyphos
pretty faithful following, and theres an outside area like sisyphos
super nice people there
apparently, right!?
it happens
haha yeah she thought it was pretty funny
haha what?
not sure tbh
hmm I mighta bought a .33l beer inside too
so I got one of those, too
and i was like... damn! that beer was awesome, what a great deal!
and then they had that same one your host dad gave us, for like 1.20
gotta try that
wow
then I saw some store had a 60 cent .5L bier and i'm like
so I'm like, why not chill with a .5L kraft beer?
and they had live music
hmm yeah I was at a biergarten
aaaaalmost didn't get back
hahaha yeah pretty funny right? traveling to Hamburg without a cellphone was interesting
maybe I left it there, in the station, haha
lost it, got robbed, literally I have no idea
haha idk
so thaaaaaat was an interesting day for tyty
I also got drunk at suicide circus, and woke up at like 6:30 on an S5 going away from Spandau with no cellphone
It was pretty ganz toll, man. ganz toll
people were older there, too
suicide circus is just like sisyphos, adagio is like similar music to Matrix, but in a huge vaulted dancefloor
Make sure to hit suicide circus and adagio before you go
Yo dog, I'm off to the states again
Come to s5

Haha a few with my cousin who's like 35. I asked for water at this cafe and she had him make me like a honey-Apple vodka drink
^ probably like 3-4 shots each, so two people buzzing for 3 euros seems pretty good
Oh that'd be super cool, probably around 9 or something? Maybe a good pregame idk. The guy I'm with owns a liquorstore that distributes to big restaurants so it's prime for pregame materials. I saw a guy get two small flask-sized bottles of smut for like 3 euros
I think I'm good all but Sunday night, there's a pole dancing battle at my aunt's studio that could be dope. If you're around you should come
7-8:30*
Yah I think I'm doing some Kung fu class tomorrow at 7-9:30 with my high-intensity cousin. How about this weekend? Where are y'all going?
Continue
Like I can't even decipher it
Like can we appreciate how poorly written that was
^ re reading that... Worlds worst paragraph
Ok that sounds cool, might hit those tomorrow if I get time. Family is a pretty big time sink but I try to escape. I got sucked into some environmental protest today though it was cool. Formed a human chain around that big parliament building
Whatsat?
What'd you do?
Okay turns out getting to Pergamom is super simple. I saw the Reichstag it's pretty dope
Ja, okay I'll hit you up later
Okay chill I might just explore today, see if I can figure out Berlin a bit
The dude I'm staying with got me a free one
I get a sim tonight hopefully
Like, if I'm lost im fucked haha
And at this little coffee shop. I might hold off for today, actually. It's just so hard without a sim
How expensive is an all month ticket?
Nah
And if I get lost don't worry about me
I might totally get lost, so I'm gonna try solo first
Okay shit it's so complicated to get there
Ja? It's 40 minute walk from you, an hour from me
Okay. So meet at Pergamom?
It's like a mile from you whore
Haha pergamoms not far?
If not we can chill tomorrow or day after
I have no sim until tonight so I just have to kinda hope that I'll get there
You whooo
You so damn far you asshole, haha. Wanna meet Brandenburg Tur or Pergamom?

?
Can you send your location
? Just escaped
Aight dog you free?
Ok cool, I'm not sure what time I'm free. My host brings me to literally everything I have to tear free
Dope, okay I'm gonna try to check out some museums today, might be able to chill later if you're around
What time you done today?
We should go to Berghain at 4AM one night
I'm working on meeting some Berliner peeps, met one cool dude at crossfit and a chick at a park today
Yeah I can't chill tonight either. If I get lost without a sim its up shit creek
Fucking hell haha
Also I have lost literally all my German
Okay dope, as soon as I get my sim I can come later/ at night. S bahn runs super late
My phones pretty multiuse at this point. Peeps have wifi plus it's an excuse to get no work done 󾌵
Cock, okay. Luckily I have no reason for a computer now anyway. Tbh might not get one
I don't have an adapter for my laptop either. You find one?
I'll see if I can get that
That's fine, should be ok
How expensive was your sim?
Ja
Everything's near like Museum Island and Potsdam platz
Yah I gotta take a bus to where you are
Mein Haus. Have to take a train

Also where are you/where are you staying
Place near where I'm staying called eurofon. Hbu?
Fkng sim store was closed
I gotta buy a sim first but then I'm all good to chill.
Shit I think I'm going there tomorrow
I'm chillin with my fam, hbu?
You in Berlin?
Ah okay, cool. What're you doing for a phone? Some deal through Sprint or something??
Nah, they nice?
Oh shit who?
any girls from our class?
Yondeen is coming, right?
Yes haha. Any nice girls around? I think clubs can be hard to get into if you're just guys
Also how's your german
Do you know a lot of the people that are going? Anyone nice?
I went out and got a good clubbing shirt today
"Yo - Berlin is fucking insane"
They look at me and are like
And whenever I talk to them and say "Hey I'm going to Berlin after this"
I keep running into people who are just like, traveling the world
It is hahaha. Dude Berlin is crazy 0.0
khushity.wordpress.com
I'm keeping a blog too
And India's dope, Lot's of pretty cool animals, good food, lot's of exploration
Yeah haha I can't get any SMS messages :(
Hey dude, how's NH?
I'm gonna get Tonybear down for some clubbing and/or Barhopping
Alright sweet, if you can stay in Berlin dat first weekend 󾔗󾔗
Like do you have your schedule yet?
Sweet, also do you know what you're up to July 1-14? I'm planning stuff today/tomorrow
Are you buying a SIM there?
Yo what are you doing about a phone in Berlin?
http://quizlet.com/71113130/german-kapitel-8-flash-cards/
do you have the link for Connect?

sounds kosher
west campus
it also moves to main campus tomorrow morning
I'll show you around and get you free stuff
haha you can come whenever
yeah I'm pretty wired tbh
running on 3 hours of sleep rn
haha nope
still have a sh*t ton to do
haha yeah but it's so early in right now I have no idea how it's gonna turn out
slept till 10:30, and have been coding since then
I coded straight from 8:30 PM to 7:00 AM
hahaha it's freaking going
how was it???
Thanks man
Tyler.petrochko@yale.edu
Yeah def pencil me in for now. Also are yo doing HackMIT?
Sick, I'm still Rails but learning some Ember.js too
Like web/mobile/other?
Yeah I'm definitely interested. What type of programming are they into?
Any thoughts on a team?
Hey dog are you doing YHack?
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4456966/how-to-send-json-data-in-the-http-request-using-nsurlrequest
Ahhh no authentication plugins? Really?
Maybe if I have some free time when I get back, but I leave for school a few days after I get back from here
In Puerto Rico atm, haha so nothing the past few days and I probably won't get any done until school starts
Yeah TyPetrochko, but the KB repo is private so it'll look like I have no recent activity
Is it really shirataki? Yeah they're like squishy. Even spaghetti squash is better than that. And yep I got them from Giant. Is that a grocery store in DC?
I've tried shittake noodles before... They're absolutely disgusting
You probably wouldn't know the difference
Better than or the same as reg pasta imho

and the nutritional info is ridiculous
that's it
the two ingredients are water and organic black beans
I'll text you the nutrition info
black bean pasta
I found a miracle food
Dude holy shit
I wanna do five classes but not get killed by 323
Hmm that could be true. That's why I wanna see if I like it
Plus Freakonomics and Economix were great books
I know dog. I know Econ doesn't necessarily encourage best business practices but I feel like to some extent I should have a better understanding of how economies work before I go out into one
Gotta make choices earl
Idk
Yeah and I'm still maaaaybe considering eecs
ugh
annoying that they "almost" removed controllers though
no views! huzzah!
Also yeah I looked at the ember release guide
plus one easy non-stem gut. idk if I can handle all that stem though haha
Phys 180, Cpsc 323, Math 244, and Econ 115
So one possible schedule is
keep in mind Cpsc 202 and Math 244 are interchangeable, as are Phys 180 and Phys 200

Em*
Give me a sec I'll tell you all of me
Plus I need social science credits or whatever
Hmm I'm still possibly considering Econ as a double major
or maybe like another math
Another comp sci might be cool, and it turns out I'm qualified for most of the 400-level ones
So far probs Intro Econ and 323
Yo man any advice on classes for fall?
It's the essential UX guide
I just got Don't Make Me Think by Steve Krug
I'm still enrolled as a student Dev, but it's pretty flexible. I know you can take time off too, which I'll do if it gets in the way
Fluffed easy over eggs


and yeah that's a pretty sick deal above
leaving me with the sole option of taking a rest day
where my entire body is too shattered to physically work out
ahhh the day after deadlift day
moooooonney
mmmmm $$$$
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G0aqVZC0eU
what's your program like now?
you'll PR I feel it
but good luck
pshh morning lifting < afternoon lifting
too damn salty
nah never liked bacon actually
pork's pretty good I'll adit
yeeep, never actually liked beef though
haven't eaten them since junior year of hs
I'd consider maybe doing some poultry but def not pork/beef :/
the problem is a lot of it is pork/beef based
also the food there just looks so good in general
I had snails in Chinatown, which were awesome
tell me that's not awesome
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqagaz2WHxU
the best food in the world
dude
You should go to Vietnam
:/
I wish I had that willpower
:0
I do
haha yeah, it seems so damn healthy
plus all the southern dishes are cooked in coconut milk :/
like most of the stuff starts with onions and an insane amount of oil
also unless you take drastic steps to make it healthier, it's pretty bad right off the bat
plus tumeric
some kind of masala
haha not the way I make them, I'm working on it though
next step is to tackle chili
I got a few Indian ones down solid
that's kind of my strategy
no idea how you got so good though
it's pretty damn awesome
haha I'm slowwwwwlly beginning to explore the world of cooking
it's like the perfect sauce for stir fry
with a bunch of tumeric
in a blender
garlic
ginger
tomatoes
when you add like
also dude
uses like 1/10 the oil you normally use
get a sprayer
bro stir fry
and then just bag em
wash and cut em all
hahaha I just buy bulk veggies
you're the iron chef bro
why do you say veggies are hard to cook?
we'll debate in an hour on that front lol
no it's not
wtf
be back in an hour
yo gotta watch game of thrones
viva la pescataria
more veggies dude
haha that's good that's good
that does it though
I drink a decent amount of kefir
haha actually not a ton
everything eventually ends up as a stir fry with a greek yogurt sauce
like that's it
shrimp
tempeh
unbelievable quantities of nonfat greek yogurt
garden veggies
2:1 egg white : egg
bro literally my diet
macros aren't quite as good as tempeh
interesting
wheat gluten
looking it up
yeah haven't had it yet though
It's pretty good, kinda tastes like a nutty chicken
I've been getting into Tempeh recently though
:( literally the only reason I'd go back to eating meat
ahhh I miss chicken breast
haha I didn't mean that sass ^ I was about to write something else but got sidetracked and went to work out
that's optimistic
forcing back and front end to be agnostic regarding one another...
Optimistically, using Loopback with Ember might be a good learning experience
that's good
oh
hmm isn't that also kind of an issue with using postgres though? we'll have to rely on some sort of adapter
Does vanilla express have ORM?
Oh, ok. Imo screw that then
ORM?
I know nothing 0.0
haha idk why I said that
yeah agreed
also, doesn't it worry you that we're kind of using untested technologies though? like, if you need help you'd be kinda riding solo?
probably the same place that you saw that
Hmm you're right, strongloop and ember don't look like they play nicely
If I do a full stack app I'll probably use rails, so I can just focus on the ember part
okay, sounds good
Still working on the movie db thing
And she's going well
Wooooo back to civilization
I've been at a lake house with bæ's family
Haha I'm in the middle of nowhere till tomorrow, I'll read about it once I get a computer
I did read about sails somewhere, but didn't look too much into it
loopback is free itself but you can pay for profiling and stuff, would you just use the free level?
I saw something about payment tiers for strongloop
ember's going well, and what do you like about it?
no prob dude
I figured you probably wouldn't (since you already interned there) but figured I'd ask
Do you want it?
Invite a friend to try a challenge. Send link below. It will only work once.
Yo I finished level two and I got this
although I read some of them require cache optimization and memoization so I might use java if shit gets crazy
So I might do the next one in python, idk
but it lets you do it in java or python
but all in all I think it took me a little under 2 hours
so I had to find a good java web ide
it was pretty easy, had some delays because they ban you from using debug statements in java (they restrict the whole system.* library) so I did it outside of the web terminal, and I don't have the jdk on my vm
just level one
Apparently if you get to level 5 in the coding challenge you get a google interview :0
will I get a popup in Gmail are do you provide a link?
ty.petrochko@gmail.com
ok ready whenever you are
oooone second
okay, sounds good
rabb.it might be good if you wanna show any in browser stuff
aight skype? fb? google hangout? rabb.it?
call???
heeeeeey buddy
which is weird considering I should have no python searches recently...
http://www.businessinsider.com/google-hiring-developers-foobar-challenge-2014-11
try googling "dependency injection"
when you put in certain search terms, it prompts you to do a coding challenge
Have you seen google's foo.bar challenge thing?
yeah sounds good
do you like my web app??
https://polar-spire-4186.herokuapp.com/
And I think Ember 2.0 doesn't even have controllers
but they also say for the most part that "controllers" are about to go away (replaced by functionality that uses components)
like all the guides I've found make heavy use of "controllers"
Gahh this is so frustrating because it seems like Ember is changing so damn rapidly
lemme know about this weekend
aight back to ember
yeah that is kinda nice
So you're probably going to be coding less once you make the jump?
?
how's fn work
B| rock on
okay let's keep it on the radar, whenever you're free really
yeah that's a good idea
but I kinda figure a lot won't make sense until I'm okay with the whole js stack thing anyway
I still don't know a lot about what you're doing on the backend
okay, sounds good, sounds good
or maybe like a "yoda tackles big political issues" app (yodaspeak + twitter api)
but uhh yeah it's the kinda thing where every employee gets the same wage
(yodaspeak api)
Haha if I can't think of a good one, I'll make a web app where top movie picks are "reviewed by yoda"
I think something with twitter or the vine api would be really cool, but I'm also looking at the vimeo, rottentomatoes, and some movie database apis
okay so for an example app I wanna use a cool api, which I've never really done before
a million in salary is insane
they have a flat pay scale so everyone in the company gets paid the same
in the posting she said it's not a typo
it's not haha
^ you probably meet all those requirements too haha
90,000/month
jesus
https://sublite.net/jobs/job.php?id=559450c0d83594d837f21b6a
so that's a biggie
but I don't have my phone
I have a huge list of app ideas on my phone
I gotta get thinking about what I wanna do as an example app
awesome, sounds good
so it'll take a lot of time to fully digest it and make something unique
but I'm following directions without fully going through anything
it's going well, I got the Todo app going on nitrous, I might push it to heroku
agreed
haha
although that addiction was a bit more dangerous
and WoW
halo 2 ftw
halo 2 is the best, in my opionion
i played it for pc a lot
combat evolved haha
http://www.drinkiwiki.com/Halo
we're doing campaign
you play halo?
haha the fam thing has turned into a Halo drinking game with the bro
will do haha
I'm buying a comp for my bro tomorrow but I'll have some time to do some intro level ember stuff
okay I gotta do a fam thing
and yeah I'll do that
haha there are a lot of jokes regarding angularjs at sdmp
Yeah I've heard that
but yeah, sounds good, I've been wanting to learn Ember for a while actually
bastards
-.-
but then they didn't
Yale SDMP was gonna have us all learn Ember
okay, I will do that
ahh sweet, that is handy
like rails g
okay, dope
Okay, I'll do that
okay so ember first?
with ember
Okay, maybe I should build a test app with loopback?
I think the biggest hurdle for me is gonna be UI-type stuff
I'm okay with JS since I used to do all my gamedev stuff in JS and I added some Ajax stuff for KB, but I've never done a js web framework
So where's a good place for me to start?
In my head I assumed Meteor was unique in the whole porting to mobile app thing
Okay, solid reasons.
Or am I comparing apples and oranges haha
Why loopback over meteor?
And where are you progress-wise?
oh cool 0,0
(Fellowship)
For YCombinator, wouldn't you have to quit FN??
/committed
Yeah, haha I'm definitely interested.
where are you learning nodejs btw?
Athstat also has potential, but when it rolls of the mouth it sometimes comes out like "ass-tat"
PostQuarter is good, but not obviously apparent where the name comes from
I like them both more than Athlytix
haha what are you up to
interesting so far...
but for right now I'm reading Guns Germs and Steel
working out, coding again, responsibility
getting back to real life very soon :(
yeah it was a bit chilly at night
:0 not a single person in 3 days
we were the only ones in the entire state park
that was unexpected, but yeah haha sure
hahaha
hbu?
just got back from a three day backpacking trip with bae
Heeeeey bud not bad not bad

idk where the slash on this keyboard is
haha in berlin theyre 24.7
yep
haha it was a pretty crazy time
and got back to my guesthouse some time before 8
then spent the next hour or so train hopping and looking for my iphone
noticed my iphone was gone
but fell asleep, and woke up at like 630 on a train going the totaly opposite direction
got on a train that should've gotten me back at 4am
left at like 330
grabbed some beers and headed off to a club
went to a biergarten
this was my night last night
dude lost my phone in berlin hahaha
Haha, dope. Good call amigo
I don't think so
0.0
for Tyler that's like a week of food in Berlin
Haha for mister entrepreneur, true
I have a friend who says he can find it cheaper, he's optimistic he can find it for like 35-40
I might buy one too

Oh. Yeah I got you as soon as I'm back. Being abroad is such a time sink haha 󾇡
Like a db schema? And what with specifically? I'm leaving for Jaipur in 2h so I'll be pretty busy next few days
And how is it?
http://www.businessinsider.com/what-ai-inceptionism-dreams-look-like-2015-6
it's supposed to take 30-60 minutes I think, but I've never used vanilla ruby before
with ruby, got each problem wrong once each
took me 103 minutes ^
http://www.trywildcard.com/challenge
http://www.gayle.com/blog/2015/6/10/developer-interviews-are-broken-and-you-cant-fix-it?
Yeah dawg
We just found a gym here yesterday, we'd been doing HIIT at like 6:30 in the morning until now lol
Hmm only the beginning of the video is loading for me. Frkn Udaipur wifi. Guy looks good though.
6-7ish or late at night
Haha tell me about it. It's the only time you can workout here
Yeah no def take that up. Taiwan is nice, and not like tourist-ized
Haha world's longest distance booty call?
Why there haha??
Haha it's not even a question bro, I can't wait
you have an apartment now?
daaamnn that's pretty sick
India really sucks the time away, plus the main guy is all about productivity
Ohh no I'm not saying it's hard, I'm saying it's hard to find the time
so atleast that's good
I've had to do some Jquery stuff though, so I'm going through the Codeschool Jquery courses
To be honest it's harder than I thought to find time to learn node.js while interning here
Yeah definitely
Also look up chaas. It's buttermilk + cumin, tastes like a refreshing taco
I'm done in India June 28th, I'll be in Berlin on the 30th, leaving there on July 16th, and get back on 17th
Haha actually we overslept so we ran
Also doing real yoga tomorrow
Haha I haven't had yet, today is the day to try
The stuff in the ice cream cone is Bhel Puri, the most amazing stuff on earth
Second to last thing is like a danish, but with curry-like stuff in the center rather than jam
It's soooo good. Super spicy, pretty similar to American Indian food tbh. And yeah it's a coconut, lol coco-water straight from the coco.

Okay 34 upvotes is pretty impressive
Damn I have 29 questions :0
damn dude you gotta get on your SO game
hehe
nice nice
wait link me your account haha
that was you? haha thanks bro <3
what's your SO account
you're 22
wtf Earl
use your awesome rep power to accept my answer
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30022265/how-do-i-get-variable-from-the-objects-that-i-have/30022292#30022292
Yeah the bar right? Claire said the same thing
By tiesto and kshmr and vassy
Listen to secrets on that playlist
Nah I like da remix
Hmm listening now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr1nN__-2Po
#addonsomezeroes
But yeah it does prove a solid point, Hudl's target has no money relative to pro/college level teams
Oo I thought you were saying they were like a competitor. I think the markets are similar but definitely little or no overlap, since yours is college level and above while hudl is HS and below, correct?
(Also my best of video is on Hudl for wrestling)
Or atleast any kind of analytics
Is Hudl a competitor though? It's mostly video type stuff and giving recruiters stats. It doesn't do tracking does it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRQv74J7oSk
damn ass to grass
okay sweet I'll def take some
Do they fulfill anything for undergrad? Like does it count as a course
Wait I can do that???
Sweet haha, I'll letcha know
I might use Rain AI for npcs, but nowhere near adding npcs haha
Jesus yes haha, Unity3D for game engine and Photon for networking
I'm actually done with all the multiplayer/networking stuff. def wasn't as bad as I thought it'd be
hella fun though, it's got shifting gravity so you can walk on walls and shit
it's an fps, but I'm only like 60 hours in atm so no idea what it'll become
(assuming I can get it on a website or publish it somehow)
sweet. also, if I spend like 100+ hours working on a videogame for shits is it worth putting on a resume in the future?
cuz 5.5 credits ontop of Student Dev might be too much
and if necessary I can drop Math 222 or Engl 132
German L2, Math 222, EENG 201, Engl 132 (Scifi), CPSC 223
Okay I think I'm good, this is what I have
yeah I can't take it anyway
also thoughts on ENAS 130?
Interesting, I might do a wr on sci fiction
like what did you do for distributional requirements?
actually lemme know if you can think of any random fun classes
Needs preregistration haha
And I'm considering it, like with Econ
Not offered in the fall I think
437?
Hahaha I think it's cool
Any fun classes worth taking?
No highschool Econ but both intro lectures are at same time as cpsc 223
(or a humanities/writing)
I was thinking either micro, macro, lin algebra, or physics if i can
Hey dude do you have any suggestions for a fourth course? I'm doing CPSC 223, German L2, and Intro to Comp Engineering
oh solid we're 121
aaaallllmost did once
hahaha yeah so far it hasn't failed in front of any yet
works like 70% of the tie
yeah haha it's uber buggy though
did you finish your hack?
Yep no worries
Hey Taara! I prob won't see her till Monday :/
Np* lol
No
All his stuff is free
Yeah http://freemusicarchive.org/music/gillicuddy/
I just finished writing the algorithm, it works really well
https://github.com/TyPetrochko/fishbrain
Oh sweet, I'll get the repo up today or tomorrow, I would read up first on how to set up OpenCV, it's basically system independent and not included in source files
You can have like four people sitting on a bench all looking at the computer and all be in the shot, with very little skew
it looks good
there's no lag, even with no optimization
yo I got the polar to rectilinear working in real time
Ey I'm in dport
don't think I do, my nums 610-322-6829, shoot me a text at some point
Alright rock on, do I have your #?
Perfect, 1 sound good? We could meet wherever.
Oh really? Any time tomorrow work well for you?
Sweet! We should get together soon to brainstorm
It's totally not a commitment, if you felt bored at any point I wouldn't be offended if you bailed.
Yeah me too definitely, I'm really lucky in that I only have one final left.
Oh sweet that'd be awesome, so you think you'd wanna help?
Haha dude you know C++, I literally have never used C++ before
Anyway, I think it's a pretty cool idea because the core functionality has a decent amount of math, some network programming, and some computer-vision/graphics stuff
Oh okay, that's pretty rad. I was afraid my idea had already been taken haha.
Oh cool, really? How similar is it?
So when I move my head side to side, it'll basically hone in on a different section as my head moves, as if I were just looking through a window at you.
Because it's a fisheye lens, it can pick up 180 degrees of your room - essentially the whole room. Because the software on MY side knows where my head is/how far away my head is, it can properly adjust the image I see of you so that I see you as If I were looking through a window.
Haha, okay. So basically the (evolving) idea is that I hook up a fisheye lens to my webcam, and you hook up one to yours. Then, we start videochatting, and the software on both my and your end begins tracking our facial positions.
Right now I'm using C++ with OpenCV, I know C++ is your forte.
Hey man, I'm looking to do that project with the fisheye lens still, let me know if you're interested.
You too man!
I have no idea
Meh I wish I knew a lot more about SQL sorry :/
But with like 10 or 20 there is, ya?
With 5 tellers, there isn't much of a difference?
Yo, for question 9, part 1, did you get that there didn't seem to be much of a performance difference?
Hey how do I get in the cs201 group?
Oh wait it's not due till Friday, according to the syllabus
Alright sounds good, is it due Tuesday?
Swell man, pretty swell. You stay or go home?
Ey man how's your break?
lol so did I haha came in with 20 minutes left in class
Did you oversleep haha?
high probability I will oversleep as I have a midterm tomorrow night
I actually got together with some of my friends in the other class, but I can try to meet you tomorrow
ey did you get all the answers for the movie worksheet?
Yo my bad for not getting back to you, I think I'm gonna pass on the offer. Thanks though man!
Thanks dude
Hmm could I get back to you tomorrow on it?
I am. What's the asking price right now?
okay, thanks mate
Hi are you still selling the MacBook air?
could I do a skype interview at 9AM?
yo do you have any idea when we leave saturday?
Oh okay, I finished the Pset on my train ride home it's not bad at all
On the practice exam?
Yo have you started studying CS yet?
Hey man, if no one buys your couch we'll buy just the cover of it
how much was it?
hmm also what're you guys doing for a tv?
that's good
Ask him, idk him really but I don't even know if he'd let us use them
yo got any better ones?
or find a way to split multiple speakers
yo also we gotta get better speakers
it was totally awesome, I liked India more though
which is when someone leans back in a chair, opens their mouth, and you pour in peppermint schnappes and hershey's syrup
also we should look at doing haircuts
how was france by the way
the cholula with lime is the best
interesting, never woulda imagined that
the sauce?
yeah dog awesome on omelettes
like the sauce? cholula sauce
cuz they bring em from mexico
mangoes suck up north though
I"m gonna try that
Damn I have some pinapple
I like it on corn and kiwis
Yeah I'm obsessed with it now
that would be super dope
apparently when you make a drink you can rim the glass with tajin instead of salt
lmao
jk
bitch
can you drink it while flaming?
what'sat?
kinda always wanted to make mojitos
so maybe like pina coladas/mojitos/bloody maries or something that'll be cheap but pull lots of people
I'm getting a blender hopefully, so we could do mixed drinks/pina coladas and stuff
yeeeaaah
good good, start brainstorming
Haha same, that's what I was thinking
you coming for camp yale?
Bro how's your summer?
Ahahaha not him 󾌬

Definitely, let me know where you're thinking
Yo where were you thinking of going? Cuz I wanna do one month on the appalachian trail and maybe a month abroad
Lemme know if you're still thinking about it, cuz I may go
Yo were you considering backpacking abroad this summer?
󾮗󾮗
No worries, we'll have plenty of time to destroy your body
With the resistance really far up. 15-20 mins of that is plenty for one day
Like the best thing you can do is get on a stationary bike, and do 1 min at half intensity, then thirty seconds at max intensity
A good cutting workout is only like 20-30 mins tops
Ohh nice. They prob have a gym, I know most hotels have nice ones
Oh shit you're on a cruise haha?
Also if you can, get some cardio in
I know I am
But like go nuts on Christmas haha
Not for now haha, enjoy your break. If your weight spikes than maybe cut back some
Hmm I'd say, if you can, explore some healthy stuff you think you might like
Pretty unhealthy*
Yeah I get that, my fam is probably unhealthy
I get too addicted honestly so I just don't eat them
I'm not eating breads/pasta/pizza/cereal or any other carb that's not brown rice or quinoa
If you think it'll be difficult to switch right away, maybe cut out some of the hard stuff over break.
Yeah lets start the first day we're back. I'm still kind of clean bulking, I'm trying to get to like 145-ish before I cut
Or on a cheat day haha
The main takeaway from the second article is that you want a lot of protein lean, a good amount of unsaturated fat, and as few carbs as possible. Honestly the only carbs you eat during a cut are RIGHT after a workout
For nutrition, this is a great guide: http://www.simplyshredded.com/layne-norton-the-most-effective-cutting-diet.html
It's a great guide to the non-nutritional side of cutting, the only thing you shouldn't listen to is that he says clean bulking is just as good as dirty bulking

Don't all hackathons pay for transport?
Damn, alright. So you're doing dragonhacks?
Why are they so selective??
Same happened for pennapps even though my team was a finalist at yhack
I ended up not applying, I have to leave for a family thing :/ I applied to HackBrown but got wait listed
Alright, thanks mate.
Ah cool, I think doing a CS thing abroad would be insanely cool but I can't find any internships.
Oh that's awesome! Which IT company, if I may ask?
Oh awesome, I'll definitely give it a try. Did you intern anywhere after your freshman year?
Alright sounds good, are you CS?
How was it? Also they don't accept freshman do they?
Hey, did you intern at Redfin last summer?
k I'm there now
What time?
Are you going to the hackspace tonight?
happy birhtday mate :D
http://www.residentadvisor.net/event.aspx?725964
1 sec
I'll link you
󾮗󾮗
Yes, definitely come
Tickets are 10€ if you buy online before 8 tonight, idk if they sell at the door
Ey there's a rooftop live dj thing in alexanderplatz starting at 11 tonight, lmk if you or anyone else from German wants to go
I'll be up a little longer let me know if you need anything
sent you the first half of the quiz, don't think it has to be long
might take a min to update though
awesome, I forgot to put in some footnotes, but I fixed it so it should be right now
np, I'll send you my half of the quiz soon too
hey so I shared the powerpoint with you on Google Drive, let me know if you can't download it
sounds good (y)
Hmm yeah, I could email or google drive it as soon as I'm finished?
with no formatting
hmm so I'm probably like 2/3 done the powerpoint up through the 18th century
sounds exciting
no worries haha
let me know when you wanna work on the powerpoint B|
heyyy dude
Wow that's awesome - thank you so much! What kind of work did you do during your trip/how did you propose it?
Hey Becky! I'm a TD-er interested in teaching English/volunteering abroad this summer. I saw that you got the Thomas C. Barry Fellowship and I was thinking about applying for it as well. Any advice you could give me?
Hey Evan, I'm a Yalie thinking of teaching abroad/volunteering this summer and I saw you received the Thomas Barry Fellowship. I'm actually thinking of applying for it as well, could you give me any advice? Thanks!
More on the application itself! At the moment I'm talking to a few NGOs in Peru, Nicaragua, and Ecuador mostly in local education/conservation volunteer opportunities.
Hey Joanne! I was thinking of going abroad this summer and I'm applying for the Thomas Barry Fellowship award (which I saw you got). Could you shoot me any advice on applying? Anything would be helpful!
Hi Zoe! I'm interested in applying to the Thomas C. Barry fellowship so that I might go abroad this summer, do you think you might be able to give me any advice on applying?
Awesome! I've made contact with a few NGOs and have proposed to teach a 6-8 week long course on some kind of programming/web design or music (for younger kids) and a few have approved me to do so. Do you think that would work well as a proposal? I realize that it's not really social development or micro-finance but it could prove a huge asset for a lot of families.
http://www.bluesparrow.org/volunteer/ is one that I'm looking at
Most of the organizations I'm looking at are pretty similar, like they teach small classes and community English classes
Hmm do you think that they prefer public health over the sort of thing you did? Also how long had you been in contact with BILD before you applied?
Hey Sahar! Sorry to bother you - but I'm a freshman thinking of applying to the Thomas C. Barry fellowship this year, do you think you could give me any advice or tell me about your project? Thanks!
That's awesome! I'm thinking of doing NGO work, so I'm not sure who would be ideal to edit this kind of stuff - but thanks!
Hi Annie! Sorry to bother you, but I'm a freshman thinking of applying to the Barry Fellowship this year, do you think you could tell me about your project or shoot me any advice? Anything would be appreciated!
Hey Kathleen! Sorry to disturb/stalk you but I'm thinking about applying for the Barry Fellowship and I saw that you got it as a freshman! Could you give me any advice on getting it or tell me a bit about your project? You taught in Morocco, right?
Okay, thanks! I just sent you the final version with your edits implemented in, I'll probably submit it late tonight so don't worry if you don't get around to looking at it. You've been absolutely killer, thank you so much for everything!
One other question - should I write how much money I'm asking for in the proposal itself or just on the application? I notice did not include it on the proposal
Okay, will do!
I realize that's super super late so by NO means should you feel compelled to do any extensive review, but I just wanted to thank you again for offering in the first place. It really means a lot.
Hey Sarah! So I'm midway through my proposal, and will probably be up very late finishing it but I'm going to try to have it to you by tomorrow morning.
Hahaha true dat. Alright dude thanks again so much you are out-of-this-world amazing B|
Honestly I think it's the sort of thing that'll probably evolve while I'm there, but it's good to have a good schedule. And yes I'll definitely be sending one your way in the next few days!
The second half would teach introductory python or Java, and they could build a really simple text-related game (like a text-adventure) by the end. The two NGOs operating out of Peru that I've talked to have both OK'ed the idea.
I'm thinking about teaching a 4-week or 6-week course on basic web development and computer programming - the first two weeks would go over basic HTML/CSS and they would all have some final project like this (http://neilsdonuts.com/)
Hey Sarah! So I've talked to a few NGOs about this, but I wanted to get your thoughts too.
I've talked/interviewed with a bunch of NGO's from Peru, and they all seemed open to the idea of teaching an introductory web-design or programming class alongside my volunteering responsibilities. Do you think something like this would make for a good proposal? To me it honestly seems like an incredibly valuable asset to have but I'm afraid it's not necessarily more compelling than social health/development or like, micro-finance, for example.
Hey Sarah! Again, thank you so much for meeting with me the other day. You are the best!
Thanks dude you are absolutely the best!!
If you know Horacio, he has some presentation thing tonight that I'm supposed to be at but I'm not sure what time.
I think so, can I get back to you within the hour?
Wow, yeah that'd be awesome. What time are you free tonight/tomorrow?
Hey Sarah! Sorry to bother you but I'm a fellow TD-er looking to apply for the Barry Travel Fellowship, could you give me any advice or tell me about your project?
Hi Tristanne! So sorry to pester you but I'm trying to do some environmental work with Bona Fide this summer and I saw that you used to be a coordinator there. Would you be able to help me out with making some sort of research proposal or point me to a faculty that might be able to help me? I'm applying to the Summer Environmental Fellowship. Thanks!
Thanks dude that helps a lot. How was living at the volunteer house? Were most of the volunteers nice??
Hey Madie! I'm interested in volunteering at Incawasi this summer, could you tell me anything about your experience with them?? Thanks!
That's awesome! How did you like living with the other volunteers?
Yes I do (a little over 8 years)! What is Cajarmaca like?
Hi Ksenia! Could you just tell me, like, what an average day would be? Also how did you like the volunteers and what did you usually do on the weekend?
Thanks!
Interesting, that's very helpful actually. Thanks, dude.
Haha uh oh, so not that great?
Hmm interesting. Any night life or good food?
No that's awesome, how is Cajarmaca?
Hey Andreas! I'm just curious what you thought about your experience at Icawasi, like how were the other volunteers, how was the program, what did you do during the day, and what you did on weekends?
Haha any summer is an incredible summer man. Same goes to you
Two weeks, then I'm off to Berlin to chill with Spinelli and Tony for a bit
That stuff's cool though. I wish I were at home sometimes for sure
The city we're in looks like venice
So like right now I'm building a giant calendar that lets you cancel camps and stuff. It's fun but feels like a huge vacation haha
We're working on this dashboard that manages immunization camps
What're you up to?
Awkward snapshot, but eyy it's dope. Just me and Abhi, exploring India and programming haha. Very picturesque

There was a dude that looked exactly like you
Yo dog were you on the stanley cup snapchat?
Yo do you have class rn? Can I check math with you??
coincidentally both Abhi and I were both in Puerto Rico
Just FYI, still haven't forgotten about the wire transfer, just currently not in the US
Hey sorry, I just got back from a few days at a lake house in the Poconos, I'll check it now
I realize it's nowhere near that simple, but on some level it's got to help
Mainly because our main sources of hindrance are also our main sources of funding
Hmm, I'm feeling pretty optimistic that it'll pass through eventually.
hmm that is annoying. there's no way you can try to convey that?
herm
??
just because of the choking hazard
ohhh okay
who??
haha
oh yeah
results wise
Hows the trial going?
yeah that's very very good
gotcha, gotcha
ramadan?
for eid?
how's the group getting along? Is Logan and/or Preethi there yet?
but I'll be back in the US soon
(using my host's old Toshiba right now)
Anyway, I don't actually have a computer here
yeah that's very inoppurtune haha
?
Not bad, how's Udaipur
It looks like it's easier for data to get from gcal to our calendar than the reverse
let me know, thanks
I'm not sure if $229 for housing already has electricity included in it
In terms of what's due, I have $229 housing, $42 for breakfast/snacks, $14 for wifi, $42 for tiffin (already paid), and $41 for electricity
I'm $69 over my grant spending, but I'm not sure I'm adding correctly
Hey Ruchit, what's the total cost for me for living here?
for obvious reasons, i.e. exchange rate
All the costs that I owe to KB I should pay via check or venmo, definitely not cash
So I am overpaid with regard to Tiffin.
gave*
Hey I withdrew yesterday and only have 400 rupees left, plus Alam owes me 300 in change from my Tiffin payment (I have him 1000 and it cost 700)
saurabh.dave@sevamandir.org
Ruchit missed a call from Tyler.
So the CSV is going to be pretty huge
In case you're curious, the first vaccination date was on 9/11 of 2012
Okay, I went through and checked some entries, and I think they're right. I'm going to do some more, though
Ok
Each vaccine should take up 2 columns
Okay, that's a lot of columns but np
So for each vaccination should I list the camp too?
Name, camp, zone, block, all vaccinations with date?
What are all the things you want included with patient?
I think, I'll look at it in the morning. Same.
󾮟🏾

If that's not true, then the 'Attendees January' table will include attendees from January 2014 and lump them in with 2015
Okay so this is banking on the fact that there should be new entries from January-June 2014

He said he had some other changes in mind we needed to discuss, but haven't heard back from him yet
- Updated some outdated features to the newest RoR equiv.
- Documented everything
- Reworked the HTTP routes and added validations so everything is more organized and much more secure
- Cancelling past events is now restricted
- Clicking on a cancelled camp event will now specify that its cancelled within the modal window
Just a quick summary:
Hey Ruchit, I finished making all of Praneeth's initial suggested edits

Sorry for long response, I'm tinkering with production server.
Okay sounds good
Ah ok.
Okay. What do you mean sync to dashboard? You won't be able to update any records on my baby production server
Okay. Are we just walking through all the dashboard features?
When are we meeting them?
It won't take more than like 10 min, so I'll start it up as soon as Praneeth merges my PR (he said he will before he goes to bed).
Western union can, right?
Hey ruchit, is there a good place to exchange in Udaipur? The rates are pretty bad in the airport.
Is there a Western union in Udaipur? Just in case I need one?
Okay, thanks
Also, I get in at 7:15 AM on May 30th, via Jet Airways.
Hey Ruchit, could you give me the apartment address we're at? Also, since I don't speak Hindi, could you give me advice for what I should do when I land in the airport?
Okay sounds good.
I'll assess whether NH or Philly is better for the next few days then, since hanging around till Monday doesn't seem super efficient
Hmm okay.
Yeah, I'm set up there now, have keys and all.
sweet
Ok cool, yep. Should I upload my stuff to Trello too? I didn't get a Trello invite
Yeah I understand, and you guys come a few days before me right?
Thanks for figuring this out, I'll be on standby until we hear back. Yeah Abhi and I are always texting back and forth. Should I relay a message?
Ok great
Just let me know when he gets back to you, I'd be fine doing android stuff. The framework is a bit more foreign but I know the language better
Okay that would work for me
sweet, any idea when?
I'll talk to the girlfriend/rents about housing next few days
okay, no worries
Okay - is the android all on BitBucket?
So it's not like I'm stranded or anything
Okay, on the bright side I do have some stuff I can get done in NH the next few days at least.
I am, could you see what he's up to the next few days?
I'm actually not sure. I have to go back to Philly anyway before my flight, so I might leave a few days earlier, not sure yet. I'll have to talk to my parents and figure that out
I understand, I wish this could've been resolved before the whole sublet thing. I actually have been able to continue my old student-dev job today, so at least I'm getting paid at the moment.
tomorrow, or not till June 1?
Hmm, that's a bit frustrating, but okay. So when will should I get oriented with Praneeth?
(same as GitHub account)
Never mind, it's good to use. Username is TyPetrochko
I believe so, I think it's registered with the last place I worked though. let me check
I never registered my last one with the KB trello
the email for it is ty.petrochko@gmail.com
no worries - also I needed to make a new Trello account
what for? village/villager pics?
I also have my iPhone since I'll be in Berlin, but I'll basically be using it as an iTouch
yeah I have one
oh sweet, sounds good
okay sweet, for data collection?
Okay sounds good. When Abhi and I aren't doing devwork do you know what we'll be doing?
also who will be there besides me and Abhi?
okay sounds good, what kind of place are we staying?
Sent you my itinerary
one second
yeah sure
response*
Tried both, still no rseponse
Hey Ruchit still no word, should I email or call him or something?
Okay great, thanks Ruchit!
Okay I texted Praneeth, hopefully he'll respond in the next day or two.
He hasn't responded to me
Okay sweet. Is he still in NH?
Okay great. Hey I'll be in New Haven later this afternoon, should we meet sometime today or tomorrow for anything? I asked Praneeth as well
You think buying a phone there is fine? Also I will have my iPhone with me anyway because I'm going to Berlin afterwards, any reason I shouldn't use that?
Anything else I need? Phone/router/bedding stuff I should handle there?
I'm also getting a Western Union account but will bring $300 in cash.
I got some long-sleeve clothes I can work in but I'll probably have to buy more there.
Hey Ruchit, so I have all my vaccines, my Visa is getting processed and should be ready soon, and I have meds for stomach bugs/diahreah and Malaria.
I've heard good things about this Visa company, any reason to use the other one over this one? http://cibtvisas.com/requirements
Awesome
Also is there anyone else who's gone through this before I could talk to to make sure I'm doing it correctly?
And you're fairly sure this is the right website to be doing this through?
Okay, damn this process looks pretty rough, apparently I have to send in my passport and stuff as well
Also it says I don't need to actually make an appointment
Oh yeaaah I remember. Abhi and I met with her
Wait who's Leen haha?
Not research?
Or is this for Indian immigrants coming to the US?
this is the correct page?
http://cdn.ustraveldocs.com/in/in-niv-visaapply.asp
Okay I'm looking into it now
do I have to apply for one and everything? like does it take a lot of time?
wait crap I haven't done anything for that
what do I need to do for a Visa?
I'm home now, will be in NH on the 19th
we haven't started talking yet, I'll email him now
Okay, then I'll wait for the phone then
Okay awesome, so get vaccines/malaria meds, get a western union account,and look at a cheap android phone
Hmm I don't think I do, should I get one?
router? modem? haha
Okay, so I shouldn't worry about a wifi modem yet?
cool, should I get that phone here or in India?
Okay are shorts wearable until I get better pants or not?
Okay, Abhi said it's best to just buy pants there since they're probably cheaper, do you agree?
Hey Ruchit, are there any other vaccines I should get besides Typhoid before I leave?
Hey I'm running 5 min late, should be there 7:05-7:10
Yeah that'd be cool lets do it
Oh okay no sweat!
Abhi also has no idea
Sorry I actually have no idea - I thought he said he'd email us
I remember you said 4:15 at Sterling but I wasn't sure where in Sterling exactly
Hey Ruchit, do you know where we're meeting today?
Okay, thank you!
Okay, thanks! Do you think I should contact them tomorrow regarding my situation? Or should I just wait until the fifteenth to draft a proposal?
(InnovateHealth, YCAP, etc)
Hi Ruchit, I had one question about travel funding. It seems like most of the funding sources for global health related projects have deadlines tomorrow, do you know if any of those have any wiggle room? I know decisions aren't released till the 15th so I was just wondering!
Thanks, will do!
Hi Ruchit! I'm interested in applying to be an intern with Khushi Baby this summer but have no experience with Hindi or mobile app development (but with plenty of desktop/web app experience). Would I be still be a viable candidate? Thanks!
Awesome, it looks like a good talk. I went to a startup workshop at the beginning of the year but haven't seen any since then
Sweet, haha I was actually watching the first lecture, it's pretty good
Interesting. That would be super cool to have something like that, I would definitely come
Hi Frank! I saw your post in the Startup page, and I'd just like to introduce myself. I'm a freshman in TD (probably Electrical Engineering/Computer Science major), I work on the Ruby on Rails team for the Student Dev program, and would love to work on/with a startup in the next year or two. To be honest, I just joined the facebook group because of the last thing but I had no idea what is was for. Could you fill me in?
Yeah he has a date, my b
Sorry my bad mate, I'll text him right now
He is, I think. Any ideas for a date?
No worries man
Okay, sounds good. He has a girlfriend so he's probably going to go with one of our friends, but I'll double check
Yep! Tyler.petrochko@yale.edu
Hi Andrew! I saw your post in Jobs and Internships and am interested in your project. Could you tell me a little more about it?
Alright sweet, lemme know how it goes.
Awesome. Are you doing anything related to this project while you're there?
I have a couple projects to wrap up this and next week and probably won't be able to meet in person before break. Is after break too late?
I also have some front-end web-design experience, including JQuery.
My Rails team is also migrating a lot of our app's UI to a front-end JavaScript framework, probably Ember, in the next few weeks, so I should have a pretty strong grasp on that by the time summer rolls around.
My team is working on Bass Media Lab's "Reservations" app, which is the web-app that lets you checkout and reserve pieces of equipment like camera, tripods, mics, etc.
I built like a company onboarding portal for LiquidHub Inc. last summer as part of a new intern program, and now I'm a Yale Student Developer on the Ruby on Rails team, if you're familiar with the program.
So I'm mostly a Ruby on Rails developer, with a Java background and some C/C# programming.
Awesome, I'd love to hear more about any ideas you have. Should I talk about my web-design experience at all?
And you were thinking of doing something web-app related for your project?
Hi Edward, could you tell me about the position you posted about in Jobs & Interviews?

it's gonna be a great year man
anyway dude I'm off to bed

bingo haha
nah dog you got it

yeah that is weird
I'm getting EMT recertified

Just a list of all the blog posts with the option to comment on them. It doesn't say like post or add post anywhere
Yo Hedy how did you post on the Blog website?
should be about ready to merge
Also I updated the kickstarters branch
I didn't know that << had so many diff meanings
Actually, nvm I got you
on app/views/backers/sponsorships/show.html.haml you said "Use << to avoid creating an unneeded temporary object."
I'm a little unsure what you meant on one of your Github comments
Hey Praneeth
Let me know when you check out the PR.
Okay fixed tests and submitted PR
also, a data_origin field on the backer model would be overkill, right?
just so you don't have to play around with it too much
I haven't added seed data, so you have to manually enter it. Should I do that before I open one?
Not yet

On the sponsorship page, you'll see this...
I'm copy pasting here obviously
Click on a sponsored child to be taken to "http://localhost:3000/backers/sponsorships/:slug"
From the backer's show view, you'll see a list of sponsored children
Where an example slug is "b767b7"
Click on a backer's "show" link to be taken to "http://localhost:3000/backers/:slug"
Navigate to "/backers" to see a list of all backers by email (will remove this later)
which is slightly confusing because there's also a backers controller... but this is how it all works out
I put all the new routes/controllers in a "backers" namespace
Okay so the basic stuff is done
I think it's best to work on the generated emails in a separate PR, since I have no idea how hard that'll be
Sounds good
I think I wrote it down but I lost the paper
also refresh me what info will be on the sponsorship page?
okay
okay, I'll do that
even if John is sponsored by two people
which is kinda nice
that way, when you share a url, it'll say like "Ruchit sponsoring John" at the top
and the uuid slug would be given to sponsorships
(s)
Patient has many backers through sponsorship
I have both
in patient.rb
so should I scrap the funder line?
But I think like front-end web apps usually share a single api key
I'd double fact check that
So like when Netflix shut down their public API they let a few webapps keep api keys
Don't most webapps do that?
has_many :backers, through: :sponsorships
has_many :sponsorships
do you want me to keep up with that naming convention or just scrap it? as is I'm using:
has_and_belongs_to_many :funders, class_name: 'User'
Also sorry to flood you but were you originally building some kind of "backer" thing? I ask because of this (in models/patient.rb):
Especially since it's not backed up
I'm not really sure how issuing API keys works with rails per se but it seems like we should be protecting/hiding that data right?
Hey just curious, shouldn't we have some sort of authentication for our api?
Ok
Many to many has more flexibility though
You sure? Ruchit told me one to many
It's not one to many though, it's one to many
two* uuid fields
it seems like most people save the slug along with the model that it applies to, then overwrite the "to_param" method, but I'd rather not have to uuid fields for patient
Okay, also patients have uuids already stored with them, but they're super long and thus probably wouldn't make good urls
know what I mean?
that way you can like, send someone a link for exactly one child
but the ux seems better with links
hmm in terms of ease of implementability I like having them all on the same page
okey doke
i.e. one backer to many children
ruchit told me that it's a one to many relationship
you don't think it'd be nice to have a url that you can refer to that has all your sponsored children?
with email I mean
so no log in?
so no route
and clicking on a child loads it asynchronously
(using a slug id)
"/backers" takes you to a search bar where you can enter your email and it'll redirect you to "/backers/id" where you'll have a list of all your sponsored children
What are your thoughts on this
I have a question for you
But yeah I'm working on it now
Hey sorry, I didn't see this message
When he gets back I'll start planning out the interface more
Okay, sent it.
Working on it now
Okay
any thoughts?
sooo we might need to talk to Ruchit about what we do.
i.e. it's probably bad to promise Alice and Bob five sponsored children each, and give them updates on the same five children...
the problem is, there's obviously no way to give updates on 500 children AND 28 unique villages without any repeats, so either we'll have to slowly give backers more "sponsored children" as more are given necklaces, OR we'll have to do a many to many kind of relationship, which to me is ethically shaky since it's kind of implied that the children they sponsored are unique
BUT, via the 250$, 500$, and 1000% tiers, we promised that we'd give 28 backers their own village worth of updates
The problem, though, is that we promised about 500 "backed children" to backers at the $100 tier and below
also I went on the Kickstarter page, and every backer has one or more kids
Hey Praneeth, so I opened a PR for changing the calling rule association from block to camp
Ok, I am on skype
Yeah I'm a little confused, I can do now
Since they're so drastically different...
and adding an "admin" and "backer" role doesn't necessarily seem smart
"User"
Like, right now the model for admins is called
Yes
which also doesn't really seem right
And it seems like it's better to add roles than create separate Devise models
Also the way Devise is configured now, we already have a User model
Yeah I did the whole Devise thing without really thinking about it, it's definitely not what we want
Hey Praneeth, for the kickstarter backers, are you okay with making a Devise User the way we have with admins?
I'll check out the github tasks tomorrow, thank you.
Sorry for late response. I'm in Philadelphia for the rest of the summer, but I can skype this sunday if it works for you
Hey Praneeth, I'm back from Berlin. What're my next priorities to work on?
Hey I'm in NH at 4pm or so, should we meet this afternoon or tomorrow to go over stuff?
I have to come one day later (19th) because of my brother's graduation on the 18th
Hey Praneeth, should I begin working on something before I come to NH?
Okay lemme know, thanks
Hey Praneeth, you said I should be back June 1st, but what's the time range I should be looking for a sublet for this summer?
All good haha no worries
And my bad
Hmm okay. Thank you for the venmo
Does the office close? I'm gonna try back tomorrow cuz it doesn't actually have that deadline on the website
So they're technically still good
Which would be May 22
Yeah, also the website says it's valid for 90 days
Oh nah



Haha yeah hindsight's 20/20
20$ for both
Okay do the receipts expire? I.e can I hold on to them
?? Okay so what do I do??
Why would I ask then??
Should I go there tomorrow?
Regardless what do I do haha
What!?!? How could I have submitted them before I knew how??
You kill me. How was I supposed to know lol? Do they expire??
What office do I take my receipts to in PW?
Okay kk 󾮟
Yo I only need a sublet may 18 to May 28, is yours free then?
Thanks man, I'll try
Yeah it was totally insane, hit udaipir, Agra, and Jaipur
Yeah I definitely have thoughts on conditioning, that's a good idea
Haha I'm sure he'll send you some huge word doc the day before season starts
What?? Really?
And I think the regularity of conditioning should be something we think about. Imo we need way more than last year, but I know people will be initially resistant
Absolutely. Idk what magic book Michael gave you on administering a club, but is there anyone we should clear with too?
Hun* lol
Yeah that's very true. Very wise, Hub
I agree
And yes I can definitely ask if we can reserve that right
Yes I totally trust him, he was my assistant coach for four years, and now he's the head of my highs school rival's program, and next year he's the head of my high school program, and he's really good
No worries, I've been the same way
Huuuuuuuun
like mid-septemberish for preseason and late november/early december for official season?
Also do you know the approx. dates when the "season" and "preseason" start?
his response: That's great. Yes, fb, etc. would keep any posts-testimonials from the athletes in good taste. You know my character and how I handle things.
So we'd all just have to say whether we thought the programs were effective
He also wants some written testimonials at the end of the year for his own business, I guess
I'll ask him about where he'll be publishing
His name is Zachariah Doll, he coached at the Hill School in PA and Germantown Academy in PA, and next year he's head coach at GA
(Also in HS he was a three-time finalist at nationals)
He's great, he used to do all the conditioning for my team, and did all the conditioning the year we won national preps
Hey Hun, I found a personal trainer/conditioning coach that says he could write some personalized workouts for our team, if we agree to let him post that we're using his workouts
Yo I only need a sublet may 18 to May 28, is yours free then?
Big and bold would work too. If you can't don't worry about it
Yeah, but not in pink. It could be any font or color, just kinda artsy

daaaamn I miss you by four days
June*
not till July right?
Dawg when are you in NH?
Ey we're climbin a mountain. I'll post pics after.
Damn
Also I was just reading about Indian bees, apparently they're the most docile. I.e. why none of us got stung immediately
Lmao Obama? Yeah the honeybees are super irritating. African ones are killer right?
The mangoes here are insanely good. Sweetest thing I've ever had
I gotta try that. The sugarcane drink was blended with lime too
It good?
Once in a Vietnamese place, but it was cooked in some sauce.
are *
Oo damn that's nice. Rajasthan is super desert-like, and the temp is like pretty consistently 105-110 F, so I'd imagine the climate and fauna is pretty similar.
Thanks man, the one with the bees is pretty funny.
Hahaha same, we were eating dinner and I just got teleported to another universe.
It was weird, didn't hit me for like an hour
hahaha
I actually have no idea
haha yeah good guess
Really lol?
Also look up what a Bhang Lassi is
khushity.wordpress.com
I will lol. I have a blog too.
Yeah it's pretty great. We might climb this mountain today and go to this temple.
Sort of. I'm building the dashboard that manages the immunization camps, Abhi helps translate in the camps and is working on the Khushi Baby website.
Haha perhaps to some extent. We don't even have desks... we basically just code while sitting in our beds.
Also that's pretty sick haha
Haha it's equally that and he's just poor with time management
And he sometimes doesn't want to take me to the field, which is really annoying.
It's def a good idea. Our boss is kind of a grump sometimes though, haha. He sleeps late, so he'll ask us to work at like 11:30 PM sometimes
Do any camps in Kenya work similarly or do you think the differences are too big?
D) It's super traditional for babies to wear neck-charms / pendants for cultural reasons, so it's super easy to store all the info in a necklace and have it be accepted
C) The huge issue that's being tackled is the organization of vaccination camps. All the camps (here, atleast) are run by a single organization, Seva Mandir, but it's super difficult to keep track of which baby has which vaccine.
B) Healthworkers go into villages, mothers bring their newborns to the immunization camps, and all the vaccinations are performed there (usually while the mother is holding the baby)
A) All vaccinations are carried out before the children is 2 yrs old, so they're not really aware of what's going on yet
Differences here:
Hmm I'm not sure if Khushi Baby would work well or not in that situation
Oh wow
Wait what makes them unscrupulous? They do it against the kids' will?
What do you mean ambush? Are the parents against it?
Are there non profits that go out to immunize in rural villages?
Haha lots of Smithsonian inventions. I'm building an e-calendar for the nonprofit here so they can view upcoming immunization camps
Yeah that's the attitude to have. Can't wait for Berlin haha
Yeah you mentioned that. That's pretty dope dude, you have mad testes for doin that all solo
Oh dayum, that's pretty cool. Going back to Kenya anytime soon?
Haha really? Why so many Kenyans?
Hahaha basically. How's Dallas?
Pretty dope. Cows everywhere, good food, lots of stuff to do. How's France?
actually I think my phone will be done in 5
lmao with what
what's the house look like?
Haha can't, phone's updating
Alright I'll come over
You still at 260 Dwight St?
what're you up to? We could lift or do something at Payne Whitney probably
Tyler called Mohammed.
Yeah we're back
Alright, sounds good!
Nope it's all going well. Calendar is coming along nicely. How's everything on your end?
any time

Some of those have multiple versions. Let me know if one is out of focus or someone's blinking or something
Okay I will, thanks Mohammed
Okay, sounds great - I can't wait to meet you!
Yes, you too! Are you moving in with Abhi and Ruchit or a few days later?
I'm well, thanks, how are you?
Hi Mohammed, what's up?
Yo did I leave a backpack at your house?
With my family
Vacation
Hey buddie, it's my last day in Puerto Rico
🐇
Hey buddy, I'm in Puerto Rico
Hey bud
you should look at their degrees
and University of Massachussetts/Amherst is a good school near Yale
Colerado is one of the most beautiful places to live in the US (lots of forests, mountains, skiing, and wildlife)
Drexel is in Philadelphia (my city)
Some ones to look at: Drexel, Colerado School of Public Health, and University of Massachussetts Amherst
Those are all good choices
what universities have you looked at?
?
which ones are you looking at
which universities?
which ones are you looking at?
What schools are you applying to?
I miss you too, dude
I know bud
that's awesome dude, I'm very proud of you
nice nice
do you run at all?
that's a good goal weight
what's your goal weight?
nice dude, that's awesome
what'sup
and very happy
Right now I'm in my house
if you have someone do it FOR you, you can't learn
It's a cultural thing, but you should ALWAYS try something yourself first
that's why Ruchit gets so mad when you ask him to write things
it's considered 'bad' to ask someone to do something for you BEFORE you've tried yourself
in the US
haha you have to understand, there's a cultural thing in the US
<3
I'll review it
damnit
you add it
haha I don't know where to add it
you should say that
so it's a bit confusing
you say "Nasir and Parvej" without mentioning who they are
The only thing I would change
like SUPER good
it's very, very, good
also I just read your SOP
Haha, Jess is allergic to pineapple juice too
and what's wrong with your tonsils?
a few weeks
sorry haha
I've been at a lakehouse the past few days
love you bud, hope you're doing well
<3
calm down
Haha I'm working on your damn SOP now
don't worry man
haha yes, I get you
probably not today, I'm supposed to go to the movies with my family and I will be working tonight
At my home, about to leave to work out
Perfect B|
10 kg?!?!?! THat's awesome dude
I lost weight*
are you still eating healthy? feeling good?
I have to work out now
haha I didn't forget, keep reminding me though, dude
oh ok
haha your english is sometimes a bit confusing, buddy
and yours?
they are great
I miss you too buddy
I know
Oh okay, I forgot you have one more year
noo why did you reach your university
what for
no it's okay
what are you up to?
not KB stuff at the moment, though
I'm working
I'm good, and you?
haha now isn't a great time, maybe tonight
not at the moment
not working haha
Tyler called Alam.
Yep I received it
you might have entered it wrong
copy and paste it
ty.petrochko@gmail.com
I did not get it
Okay I can't work on it today, so you have to remind me
sounds good
<3
you add it, I'll polish it
ok
ok
ty.petrochko@gmail.com
yeah send it to me
someone to polish it?
oh, then why do you need someone to draft it if it's already finished?
someone can help you but you have to actually write it dude
why would someone else draft your essay?
what do you mean?
hey bud
haha well perhaps in the future I will learn hindi
how are your other brothers?
haha, you're a good man Alam
but anywhere in the US is good
okay, I hope you can come here
I know bud, it'd be nice
and I will be thinking about them
I'm sorry :/ I wish them the best
but are they okay?
that is very true hahaha
and why were they sick?
*were sick
noo I'm saying how is your home?
how is it
not much
hey buddie
yes yes I will
hahahaha you drive a hard bargain, but ok
I must go workie
okay
"She said it to me 10 min ago"
yep
there you go
Just 10 min ago*
we went hiking for 3 days
I spend too much time with the girlfriend

Okay, I must go and do KB work

I know man, and I will come to your wedding

my mom is a very wealthy woman
hahaha no thanks buddie
hahaha thanks bud, but I'm going to take my mom's old phone
Miss you too, buddy
I'm happier without it
Haha it's okay
:(
I think someone stole it :/ although I don't know
I fell asleep
On a train :(
haha I lost my phone
5 days ago

Aww :(
You are not coming back?

My home is your home, bro
haha ok

2:52
2:42
almost 3 am
anyway, goodnight my friend
"He was" is for events that are in the past
"Yeah when he is in yale you can ask them"
"When Ruchit is in Yale"
Honestly, she's way too sexy for him.
Sounds good.
Haha ok.
Can I ask her about it
I don't believe that. Hahaha...
No.
Really?!?!
What?!
What?
Anyway bro I must sleep, getting up soon
as does Jess
I miss you too, man. My parents have much respect for you
I miss India a lot more than I thought I would
Haha I'm already looking for a way to come back
I've talked a lot about you since I got back
how is home?
Also I'm about to give Jess the earrings, I'll tell you how it goes.
How's India? Any new blog posts
<3
I'm back in the US dawg, safe and sound
Haha I'll do that, thanks buddy ❤️
You such a badass, homes slice
Ha
Ha Alambhai
Hamburg Germany
Yeah I leave the sixteenth, but I might go to Hamburg or Dresden for a bit
Yep that format looks good. I do the same
Sounds so. And yes I would agree haha
Looks like a good entry haha^
Pics look good
󾮟🏼󾮟🏼
Ok cool 󾰛
So no blog for now
Hey bud I still can't use a computer 0.0
It's cool. Very similar to USA. No cows here
I am well, Germany is nice
It was great*
How was it
❤️
Miss you too
:*
Those are the best kind of day, huh ;)
Hey buddie what's up
So big
Also, people in Germany are huge
How many GNMs?
How did it go?
And you? Me too ❤️
Great, Germany is nice
Hay bae
󾌯 Berlin is so busy
Haha I haven't slept yet
Very tired 󾰴󾰴
Hey bud, made it to Berlin
Okay Bhai, will do
Hey baby, I'm Munich. How are things in Udaipur?
Hold on baby

Alam missed a call from Tyler.
Outside
󾌧
Heeeey
thanks hon
Haha I'm okay <3
Nah he didn't forget, we just haven't gone to bed yet. If he forgets I'll do it.
Got it
I gotchu
http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/lee-labrada-12-week-lean-body-trainer-nutrition-overview.html
You too! Let me know if you're interested, though. It probably doesn't really matter
Hey dude, you're an iOS Dev right? There's a rising senior who's doing a startup and needs some lead mobile developers to start on a project, lemme know if you're interested
Vielen Dank, Stefanie, für Alles. Bald muss ich die Geschenke zu Patricias mitnehmen.
Ja, ich bin :)
Ok, wenn ich nach Hause gehe, werde ich ein neuen Account machen 󾮗
Hey Steffi, hast du ein Microsoft account?
Hey Stef, how do I get into the building?
Ooo thanks. Is it okay if I use your iron? I will iron anything else you have if you want (I'm not the best)
And what's the name of the building?
Ok
Oh not Westhafen?
Ok! That's okay, I will go alone. I will have no problem getting to Westhafen, but do you know the name of the building?
Also, should I go there solo or will you be driving in that direction?
Hey steffi, what time is Luta Livre?
Hey steff, I got home pretty late so I will probably sleep through breakfast. If you have a static pole class today, I might be able to make it
Absolutely! That works with me
Oh ok I thought you meant 11 pm, haha
Ok, I think it's only open till 7, or so it says online
What type of climbing is it? Rock climbing or something similar?
Yeah that would be cool. I'll ask
Sure, I'll ask - what time?
Hey Steffi, I'm leaving the apartment now. I was thinking of stopping by the studio to check in, is there anything I should help with? I can pick up a pizza or help lucasz break down the poles
I should have said something earlier. Also don't mind being stressed - it happens to all of us and you handle it much better than I can
We can talk more at home of course, but I am incredibly sorry for any inconvenience I have caused you. I know I should've told you this earlier, but please don't worry about making food for me or anything because I don't want to offend when I sleep in too late
I was not trying to be rude and I will do all of that. I waited for a while at the Studio to say goodbye to you and Cindy, but it seemed like you were both in a very involved conversation and it seemed impolite to wait next to you for more than 15 minutes.
Steffi, tut mir leid für alles 󾰕
Ich bin in Alexanderplatz, ich will heute abend oder nacht nach hause gehen. Ich habe die Key für das Hause, so don't worry about me
Hey Steffi! Deine Studenten waren wunderbar 󾮗󾮗
Ok! Ich komme
Ein moment..
Ich hatte nicht gelesen
Oh okay! Das bustation

Und klar!

Ok! Wunderbar! Was ist deine Adresse? Wenn mein Flug zu Spät ist...

Mmhmm! Mein Flug ist am 16 Juli, ist dass ok?
Es ist sehr heiß... und am Montag, hatte ich das Taj Mahal gesehen
Mmhmm! Ich bin in Udaipur. Es ist eine kleine Stadt, mit viele Sees.
Ich habe viele Probleme mit "werden" und "wollen"
ich werde? ich will?
Haha, und ich will (hoffentlich) mehr Deutsche lernen.
:D
"similar" = ahnlich
similar
freu*
Haha, wunderbar! Ich freue mich
Ist dass änhlich?
Ah! Ich habe sehr lange Brazilian Jiu Jitsu lernen gemocht!
Was ist Luta Livre?
Nein - ich habe dass nicht gehört.
Ah ok, ich bin aufgeregt! Ich ich, außerdem.
Wunderbar!
Ah nein, ich bin sehr erregt! Ich weiß nicht, ob 'erregt' richtig ist...
Ah, dein Englisch is fantastisch! Viel besser als mein Deutsche...
Hey Sefanie! Ich bin Patricias Relativ (Vetter?), Tyler. Bitte entschuldigen Sie meine schlechter Deutsche, aber, wie geht es Ihnen?
󾌯 literally impossible to keep up
The clubs start at 1 am and go till 9-10 am
I'm gonna buy tickets today if possible

Haha I've let my liver rest the past 24 hours so I'm good to go tonight
One more weekend in Berlin

Haha okay, get em dude
Any Ruchit freakouts?
Oo 󾌯
Why?
Leen left :/
How's it at HQ?
Jesus Sanjana, I think it was an acronym like THS or something
And fucking huge
Berlin is nice but people are a bit colder
I miss that :(
Yep. Not kidding she picked me up from the airport, took me to a deep stretching class, a pole dancing class, then shopping, then to her house, then to watch her class for little kids, then to a crossfit workout, then to an Escrima class.
Made it Berlin, somehow ended up in a pole dancing class 󾌯
Thanks dude

Cover charge?
Ahh good
Are either of them difficult to get into?
Haha no worries
No worries my friend. Any suggestions?
Hey my friend and I are actually going out tonight, would you like to come and/or suggest a good place? We went to watergate last night
So definitely yes 󾮗

Ah superkühl! Welche Uhr?
Ey David, wann machst du Crossfit wieder? Weil ich fühle mich besser, muss ich noch mal kommen.
its only 1.3 kilometers but like each painting is just awesome
Yeah, you could spend like a whole day there
my favorite thing in berlin by a hundred times
haha yes... hmm also definitely east side gallery
not the hardcore techno
It's really really cool on the inside, and the music is very American/Toadsy music
Also you guys have to go to a nightclub called Adagio if you have the time.
Yeah haha, hopefully
Haha yeah, probably
haha so I'll go next time
:( was gonna go today but I got stuck helping my host with her computer
The only thing I missed was the Bundestag dome thing
Oh dope, that is pretty cool
what's that?
The only thing I didn't do was the Bundestag
?
What else are you guys doing
yeeeeep haha
Talked to a bunch of super drunk Aussie's for like an hour\
hmm, I got there a little later I think
Haha yep, we were definitely both there at the same time
http://www.delidauerdienst.de/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Sironi-3.jpg
Haha we were probably there at the same time
Oh crap it is thursdays, was it called Markthalle Neun?
Giant wooden junglegym?
Did they have like a playground and stuff in there too?
Ooooh okay, maybe you were
Hmm it's in like a big indoor kinda building, kinda like an airplane hanger. Maybe Kreuzberg?
almost all vegetarian or vegan
you 100% have to go
there's this huge streetfood market
also, on Wednesdays
my thoughts exactly
only it's deep fried cheese
It's like tofu
I know... Halloumi is super bomb if you'd had that
haha
It's basically just salad though
Yeahhhh, that I've had
:(
oh woops
Yeah :)
it's not vegetarian...
also I ate lahmacun thinking it was vegetarian... :(
I'm going out to get dinner in a little bit, but I was gonna get some dirty falafel from a Turkish place in Spandau
Oh really? Yeah ask her where
haven't found any :/
I miss having structure to my day, so I'm pretty jealous, and yeah I've been looking
ooh I'm sorry, that is rough
Also, no joke I have had no German food here
yess it will be awesome
Also, I have sooooo much time... I think I've seen everything there is to see in Berlin
then Berlin for two
went to India for four weeks
then came home briefly,
Because I spent 10 days at NH
Almost eight, really
It's been six weeks for me
haha a little bit... I'm so ready to go home though
sadface
Tomorrow I leave at nine :(
Jaa :(

ooo also I have an extra SIM
oh dope then definitely hit the redlight district

there's a huge lake in the middle of Hamburg, and you can eat food on this terrace overlooking the lake
Hmmm the famous thing is the red light district, but idk if thats a thing during the day
only for a few hours though
I was there today too, actually
Haha I know. How was Hamburg?
Jk I leave Tuesday
Whenever the 16th is
I think till Thursday, I might be in Hamburg starting on Monday though :0
Hey so turns out there's a rooftop party thing at The Weekend tonight, wanna do it?

Oh dang that's awesome. 12 euros right? I already hit the Pergamom
Didn't you guys go to museums today?
0.0 wow that is impressive
Wow, kudos spinelli haha. Poor man got home at 5
Also was Spinelli in class today? We were out last night
Haha yeah, I'm doing some stuff with my host at like 5-7 but after that I'll do something

Haha yeah we were 󾌯
Where we're off to ^ were also going to some clubs tonight I'll let you know

Actually we're just chilling now haha, haven't made it there yet

If you're bored and around send him an fb message
Hey dude Spinelli and I are going to some pool and an abandoned airport thing (supposed to be cool)
Alright cool, thanks mate 󾮟🏼
Hmm how nice? Are jeans and a buttondown good?

Any thoughts on suicide circus or adagio?
Alright dude thanks, electro is good
Also what're your other two friends' names, never got their fbs
Hey man, a few of my friends are going clubbing tonight, any suggestions on good ones to go to? Probably just me and one other guy, or me and one guy and one girl
Yo there's also a rooftop party at The Weekend tonight, I think tickets are 10 € online
It's like a chill bar/music venue with live stuff tonight
Hey homeslice I'm thinking about hitting up Schokoladen later tonight (around 11 or so) lmk if you or anyone else is down
He says use fb or whatsapp
I'll ask him in a sec
You can always fb him, idk if his Berlin # is the same
Do you have data?
Haha sure, sounds good
Haha ok, I'll probably be with Spinelli. Text him as I have no wifi haha
Same, any idea what direction?
Hey what're you up to bud
Oo okay. Super hardcore techno?
You there now? Long line?
Now?
Hey no idea if you guys are still here, but there's some huge pub crawl going on near warschau for like 12 euros. My friend and I aren't doing it but it looks like a lot of fun. You get free drinks at each bar I think
Krakow too, which is really nice
But yeah we def sang in Salzburg
Haha he wasn't very good 󾍇 even he'd admit that
Jamie and I did something similar in Austria and Poland for school, I bet we sang at some similar places
Where did you sing in Austria? Also are you going to Poland?
Ohhh that's really awesome dude
What are you doing this euro trip for?
Haha true that 󾮗󾮗
Forced philanthropy I've heard it called
Aw, that happens whenever you go to places with tourists. She's probably super in need - think of it that way!
Okay, no worries. Austria is amazing supposedly I'm sure you'll love it 󾌵
Might stop in Hamberg or Dresden for a bit
Okay, I'm in Berlin till the 16th
Absolutely dude, 󾮟🏼 Jamie said you're in Germany so if you want to get together for a bit please let me know.
I'm so sorry that you have to go through all that, your dad was a really funny and super cool guy
Heyyy Becca, I heard about your dad :(
No sweat man, I'm still not decided too. Got back at like 6am 󾰕 but I'll letcha know how chalet is if I go

Also def go to Weekend next Wednesday, the rooftop is super dope
Ok, have you been to chalet?

Clown one, right?
Any plans?
Absolutely man, rest well
We'll be in five min
Naaaaaa dude come

http://www.residentadvisor.net/event.aspx?725964

Alexanderplatz club called the weekend
Hey man you in Pennsylvania?
A guy jumped in who couldn't really swim
:(
Last friday someone died there unfortunately
But it is about 40 feet
Crap I think I will be gone then :/
Mate when you come to philly http://youtu.be/XXORI2HxpwU
<3 <3 <3
Okay - I'm leaving for airport now! Can't wait to see y'all
I'll see when that is
Okay, I told Jess we'd hangout Wednesday afternoon after she gets back from NYC
Yes she's away, so it will be just us
I'll ask, but I think she's in NY that day
On Tuesday? Nothing would make me happier... No joke I've been looking forward to Vietnam Cafe for six weeks
and no I did not
immediately after final security check, post immigration
Got it, that works for me
Bud you doing HackMIT?
We won't really know until the year starts. I've been talking to my captain but he hasn't gotten back to me, and he probably won't know details for a little while
I'd say probably depends on the week
Okay, I sent a few more messages to my captain. Will do
usually during midterms in the fall there's no practice
sometimes less, depending where we are in the academic year, etc.
okay, during preseason numbers are a bit lower, usually 6-8 at each practice
But we've been doing a lot in the way of recruiting, so hopefully 14+ regularly at practice
Last year we had about 14 full time people on the team, usually 10-14 at practice
We won't know exact number of athletes until the beginning of the year
He wanted me to ask you what kind of post it would be, like fb or on another site, etc.
Hey coach, I talked to my captain/coach and he's interested.
Yeah, haha, I heard. What's coach Hill up to next year?
Absolutely, I've been doing some HIIT on my own so I'll be in shape to lead all the conditioning
Awesome, thanks coach. I just sent him a message
Yep, we did that for a few practices last year, but there's about 10 minutes of overhead in moving there, so it burns a bit of time
Let me double check with my captain, but I'm fairly certain that would be okay
If our attendance is high enough this year, we'll move to the gym and roll out the mats before practice
It's about the same size as the middle school wrestling room at GA, maybe even a bit smaller
The other obstacle is that our room is too small for sprints/suicides
I think some wrestlers would be okay doing extra conditioning outside of practice, but I'd like to maximize the 10-20 minutes we get at each practice
the main technique coach is a junior who's technically very good, and I'm handling conditioning
So the captain is also the head coach, who is a senior but honestly not a great wrestler
Club sport, entirely student led
Well, usually we get three practices during the week, and on each practice we have 10-20 minutes to do conditioning (apart from live wrestling)
Awesome
That works
We could facebook call, or I can borrow a phone and call you
I don't have a phone this week, I lost it while I was traveling
Awesome, thanks coach
Okay, sounds good
I was kind of making them up at the end of the year last year
Hey coach, how are you doing? I'm managing all the conditioning for Yale wrestling team next year, do you suggest any good resources to find HIIT-type workouts?
Okay, thanks for the info! I'm on vacation the next three days, I'll think about it and get back to you when I'm back if I'm still interested!
Hey Eliot, could you tell me a bit more about your tutoring post?
Home your summer is going well too dude
Haha I don't see why not, and thanks Lelina bear 😃
Haha you too! Someone should check if they're still down with it
Also this is all assuming Alec and Ali move into RH, which I'm 85% sure they are
Yeah I think everyone in my room isn't attaches
Yep, I think so
I think everyone else is
I said I was okay with it
what'd she say
yeah np
might wanna email her
i guess
i think we just have to do an oral section and a written section in the AP book
hold on
i just glanced at it
some bitch answered
yeah i had 4515 at the end
Ahhh. Called the wrong num
Do you have her num?
Hmm aight
Nah I just never did. What did you talk about
Yo when we call mrs romeu what do we talk about
thanks
hmm ok
what did you do?
she said on VLE Continuaremos con la siguiente sección de Rosaura, "David canta su salmo" pp. 101-110.
hmm

It's just for freshman, I had to apply for it though so I'd feel like a dick dropping it :/
I'm also in a biweekly lecture program called perspectives on science and engineering but it's uber boring. And the gym here is sick, it's called Payne Whitney and it's a super huge fuckin tower with a bunch of floors. Our residential college has a small shitty gym in the basement too haha
Damn dude, I'm taking compsci 201 which is more algorithm-based using Scheme, math 120 (multivar), English 114 (farm bill and policy of agriculture), and intro german

sooo I really don't know what to think
but hey, Jamie is unreliable
and says most other people with it claim it's unreliable
but my bro has it and says it's unreliable
which is nice because it has a 15" display, I'm a longtime dell user, and it seems to be a well-rounded one
also thinking about the Dell Inspiron 15" http://www.dell.com/us/eep/p/inspiron-15-5547-laptop/pd?oc=fnosm2606b&model_id=inspiron-15-5547-laptop
I'm also not sure on what computer screen size to get hah
you can pour water all over it
also super resistant
14" screen, which is slightly larger
but you can get it solid-state
yeah I probably will, this one seems kinda clunky
http://shop.lenovo.com/yale/us/en/laptops/thinkpad/t-series/t440s/
also the Lenovo T440s
hold on
thats my first one
Which is pretty thin, is a convertible so it works as a tablet (even though I wouldn't use it too much)

already done niqqa
but the way its presented in the song affects our interpretation of it, so we automatically link it to one way or the other
and the point of it all is that the melody itself is neither masculine nor feminine
but one is like really strong and masculine, while one is more timid and feminine
that are practically the same, with same chord progression, melodies, etc.
i wrote like these two piano songs

alright hw calls
to see which can also be adverbs
haha i'm suddenly looking up every adjective
wow that's so weird
Yes I ran quick.
quick is one too
oh shit
it's not always that way though
yeah
both of them
technically correct
yep
which can also be safely, slowly, and entirely
examples of this are: safe, slow, and entire
but some of them have versions with -ly on the end, but also can be flat adverbs in themselves.
is another
great
fast is a good one
meaning they don't have -ly
there are a couple flat adverbs in the english language
slow can also be an adverb :/
is grammatically correct
"I ran pretty slow."
the sentence
funfact

yo you can ride with Harrison tomorrow haha
also
?
why not
12:02
no
what?
idc
set an alarm
you fucker
don't umm me
i want it as anti-raid insurance tonight
and you'll be able to give me a dragon
get on
so at 12:02
exactly four hours left
seriously though i better have a motherfuckin dragon
and yeah that high honors thing takes up some time
do homework
and if time permits
capitalize on raids
raiding, upgrading, capitalize on upgrades
you gotta go to the fundamentals man
and oh boy do i have spare time
and i play harder
i work hard
just because i have a fucking sicknasty clan doesn't mean i had to spend money to get it
haha i didn't though, Neema's guessing too
what? i didn't spend any
i expect dragons tomorrow morning
yo so in 5 hours i get level three clan castle
my comp's broken as soon as i get a new one i'll install some shit and get you started
haha do you man
so that's why i'm saying start little, then work up
unless you had some proof that you're legitimate
a company wouldn't really listen to you
the thing is
i highly doubt that was the first time the game designers attempted to make a game...
come to terms with the fact that your first game is going to suck, take the most time, and be the most simple one you ever make
plus, dont think big picture
ehhh that stuff can be sketchy
with one of the history teachers from GA, so that's about all the capitalist enterprise i can handle for a high school career
plus, i'm actually designing some software that i'm going to commercially release next year
haha i don't have the time, motivation, or ability to really get any commercial recognization
then kinda stopped during sophomore year, then kinda resumed last summer
all frosh year doing game design stuff
hmm i spent like
for a while i was considering it
well have you ever thought about doing that in college?
haha no prob man
i don't have a lot of time, but i can def atleast get you on the right track
yeah man i'll mentor your ass
where they listen to prospective game designers' pitches and will like give you money and resources and shit
Project Aerospace
has something called
i know Bungie
well
which, i know, seems like a lot of time
and if you really applied yourself to it you could definitely get something done by the time you graduate highschool
i could probably atleast get you started
if it's really something you're passionate about
hmm
it's a prety good idea for a game
haha i like it
continue
mmorpg version
haha cloverfield: the game
whatsat
nah
oh das cool
don't
yeah don't really follow facebook either bud
idk i don't follow rankings
in wrestling or clash of clans?
that means we won't get any shit for being out
that's pretty epic
okay
oh
how many wrestlers were out?
nine people on the wrestling team?

yeah i mean i don't know anyone that's like "high school was the best time of my life"
yeah GA sucks :/ i feel like it's sort of a social nightmare at times
i think it killed my enthusiasm
i was like the most outgoing kid in my class
haha so before GA
haha i feel like that's happened more than once but yeah..?
haha yeah of course
*but
haha yo keep this a secret buy i actually applied to Hill for this year
honestly i just hate GA

and she like loves me
she haaaaaaaaates Alicia
omg...
hehe
haha also disregard the "dude"
dude have you noticed she's been in the worst mood this week?
but Mr. Nelson is like the best math teacher ever... i've literally yet to do any homework and i think i have an A-
hahah omg Mrs. Dann is like that with bio.
haha yeah math this year is actually surprisingly fkn hard...
do you honestly wish you were in AP?
haha yeah i sorta like her though. after that C+ i got on the first essay i literally hated her for like a month, but i'm sort of okay with her now
haha yeah she like makes everyone out to be an asshole, but i'm sooooo glad i didn't take AP
hahaha does her negativity ever get to you though?
and i mean this year is pretty fun
McVeigh haha
;D because i hate history with a fucking PASSION and i would kill myself in AP
history class was the only class i legitimately enjoyed
sophomore year
but honestly
haha so i did get in
i have no idea why though, honestly
haha i did
haha did you take the test?
like, "what century are we in again?"
she has like this perfectly straight face
nooooo i feel you
haha i've lost faith in our history class
and yeah i feel ya my highest SAT section is grammar
YOU'LL DO REAL GOOD -.-
SMOOTH SAILING EMILY
hahaha i know... honestly i wish i had just been like
haha yeahhhh she always tries to make me out like an asshole
real awkward
yeah haha and Alicia called me an ass :(
like honestly, probably just easier to rewrite the whole sentence
Know for its rigity and structure, people at the end of the 19th century came to realize that the Victorian era was no longer an acceptable type of lifestyle.
it was like
raped the shit out of her paper
i literally
omg perfect verb
yeah haha and she got pissed when i corrected them all :(
haha like i was actually offended
and i love emily erwin but her grammar is terrrrrrible
i had to do emily erwin's
when we had to proofread
haha in class
i DOOOO itz beautiful.
like what some geeky girl would say to a frat boy...
i realize that sounded like kind of a half-hearted compliment?
you have really nice grammatical structure
yeah haha
i actually really like it haha
really?
you get a free pass for being sick
haha no prob
haha still want me to proof it?
heyyyyy did you eva finish yo paper?
adioooosophie
hmmm that's like one of those poems where it takes me time to digest
i'll have to think about that
hmm
otayy
and aight pce sophieee
noooo :( you're better than like most of our class
yeah i'm kind of boned haha
hmm you should definitely be in AP English
damn kind of reverse instincts?
wow that's super messed up, but no i heard of one where that happened to like a little girl for like 20 years
only 6,000 words actually
and it's a pretty old book but it's really short
i like started reading the first page
and it's like all her journal entries...
and she starts to go insane
by her husband
for like months
the diary of this woman who's locked in a room
it's fictional, but it's basically
so there's this book
but do you know "The Yellow Wallpaper"?
just at the time i wanted to finish it
yeah i do that now haha
i've never read it though
i know like the perfect thing for you to read too
holdup
wait
i sorta figured nobody'd be reading it
and i wish i had textmarked it more
hahaha i did already
and it freaked me the fuck out
i haven't :/ i love Donnie Darko though
yeah my dad and Chris actually always tries to get me to read it...
yeah you know some dude read it and like became a murderer? and yeah it was my first choice for reg i think
i thought it was sooooo crazy how it like portrayed him kinda getting more and more unstable
what'd you think?
wait sorry you didn't read Catcher in the Rye did you?
yeah no lie i have kind of a mancrush on him...
yeah it's gotta be one of the best movies out there... and i have like a total love of Christian Bale
damn kinda wish we'd discovered this earlier but that's so chill.
hahaha i should warn you my head is a fucking mess
also have you read The Catcher in the Rye?
haha i should warn you it's mildly textmarked, so you'll kinda have a gateway into my head from the beginning...
yeah haha do you want it?
hehe probably not but it's like a dystopian novel that's got some bioethical themes in it that are super cool
have you ever read Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?
haha i chose Dolly/Cloning for my first bio paper haha
ponder club?
haha what would we call that?
ethical philosophy regarding cloning, genetic modification, organism experimentation, human engineering, bioengineering interfaces, that sort of thing
and bioethics is like
i feel like we have all the same interests haha
yeah no i actually totally get you!
do you like bioethics or anything like that?
and sometimes i do that sort of thing i guess
well i do have like a journal thing that i started in like 6th grade
damn girl i'd actually like to hear some of them that's awesome
really? i always think that thing but i'm too afraid to tell anyone cuz they'll think i'm a freak haha
really? i'm really enjoying this new whole side of you sophie haha
i'll be your tech wizard...
haha stay like this pleaaaaase
hahaha noooooooo!!! you're just super nice now
haha soph when did you get so nice??
awh thanks sophie ;D that's supa nice.
haha this is the sort of thing i can't tell people
yeah like Chris haha
3 year project...
it's like that academy scholars thing...
and i'm doing all the programming and marketing and stuff
he's doing like all the geography stuff
yeah haha. he and i are actually working on developing like a geography teaching program
remember Mr. Stephens?
yeaaaaaah haha :( it's sad. i try to keep it on the DL
it's horrible
like i spent sixteen hours coding my last year's science project haha
yeah but sometimes you'll start messing around at like 11 in the morning, and suddenly at like 4:30 the next morning you're like how the fuck did i just do that?
like sooooo many people come to me for tech issues it sucks
*become?
really? damn haha that's so cool. and trust me no you really don't. once you be come one there's no going back
yeahhhh haha those computer things come in handy a lot...
actually not really...
haha i sorta wish i could do that
hahahaha omg it's like such a perfect match
do you know the poem "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening" by Robert Frost?
no judging here
also
that was my first thought...
i spent like two minutes staring at it haha
i'm not a physical art person but i like love that
like hooooooly fucking shit
and i liked it
because i saw that on her cover photo
i was gonna ask her tomorrow
haha you lazy fuck, but nah seriously you'll be fine
so it's ridiculous that we need like 2 and a half weeks to write one
but for us we probably do a 2-3 page paper once or twice a week?
what your workload is like in English
i don't know like
for the paper
haha
yeah they cut out all the speeches this year
and honestly, for the paper
yeah that was terrible
actually that was just me making fun of sam but still
we spent one day making fun of Taft and another in the library making fun of Sam haha
haha whaaat? this has been a really easy week
no teacher's gonna get pissed because you didn't do hw while you were sick
haha and you don't need an excuse either
and you know there's a syllabus online haha?
haha nah you're fine
haha you chose good days to miss we didn't do shit haha
and yeah i'm positive

hmm Andrew Matula
see whenever you're mad you're perfectly fine at conversing
I just don't believe that you are THAT bad at conversing
well maybe you're used to it
I mean I end up looking like a fuckin idiot all the time
than play it safe
that you make yourself look like a complete idiot
by a thousand times
You don't realize that I'd rather
but I'll just listen
I wasn't going to leave I was going to speak
are you done?
chill for a sec
Natalie if you need someone to talk to and you're willing to TALK
You really need to do the same.
I woke up.
Yeah I did and I was trapped just like you.
because you purposely try to be awkward and just I hate how you try to make it seem like I'm treating you miserably and everyone hates you. At this point there's only one person responsible for your sadness and that's you. Until you recognize that and learn to shape yourself up I can't go on like this.
now I am
how can you expect someone to not give up on you when you give up on them?
so yes
well obviously you gave up long ago
okay well if you can't make conversation than I'm not going to try?
well than don't try to make conversation
intelligence has nothing at all to do with it
not difficult
thats like
see
you: hmm I sorta know what you mean
me: haha it's like one of those fun outlet malls that's outside
you: Hmm never heard of it
me: IDK Limerick Plaza maybeee??
you: oooh which mall??
me: Sooo I'm going to the mall tomorrow
watch this ready
I mean
then maybe we shouldn't talk
if it is honestly too difficult for you to think up something to say to a simple statement
you: stop what
me: stop it
you: what?
me: -.-
you:cool
me:ok sooo I'm thinking of going to the mall tomorrow
you:okay
let me talk
shh
me: Okay I'll start
Okay that's a great idea!
let's start a conversation
okay
We'll be like
what's going to happen
let me just tell you
before you say something....
Wait
What? You're deliberately vague.
Bye.
A question mark is not a question it's a punctuation mark.
At least for now.
The apex of our friendship has passed.
Well we...
I wouldn't worry about Alicia haha.
aww but you have friends
?
Aww why are you sad.
No it's fine it's not working very well anyway.
Are you going to say something...?
Ok...
...
You sure?
You may.
Sooo...
You do it I don't wanna talk to him.
That doesn't mean much either.
Well you have more facebook friends than me. Not that that means much but I guess you have more of a life than I do.
I'll cease to confuse you.
sorry
Probably once upon a time it was phonetic :)

uhm haaha alicia thinks shyam and alec
haha and me

besides the whole kissing and sex or whatever and whatnot
yeah i guess
its too late to go back haha
idk why were talking about this
and nat
yeah
idk
sigh
well
yeah :( i deserve that
it makes me really jealous to see you with silverman but i deserve it

aw <3
and yeah your too good to let go
haha maybe i need you too?
wow just the thought of that made me really sad
you'd be done with me :(
and it fizzled out
if we did date
yeah but then again
like ending a curse?
yeah
ahahah not really :)
thats a lil long
aw
and i mean my mom and he are really good friends
like a year younger technically
well
happily, and they have two girls me and jamie's age
and the guy is married now
and my mom found someone else
but another girl entered the fray and stolllle him away
and almost fell in love
and then they came back and met
and saw other people
and then they went their seperate ways
till the end of High School and first year of College
on and off
the beginning of High School
starting from like
Scott Soffen
my mom had a relationship with a guy
know whats weird?
yes
all that means is yes i believe in fate but i think we make our own choices
hehe
aren't you glad you asked?
we choose our own paths but in reality the paths were already layed out and were just slaves to quantum physics and just whoever makes the rules of our universe
i think fate exists, but is objective and unbiased yet real nonetheless
well
but in the sense that you have come to interpret the macabre phenomena yes :)
well my belief is fate is kind of confusing
fate's weird
do you think were kinda fated to be together?
ok than
no its ok
lol duck...
yeah
ok nvm
oh
question
hey
ok haha
i more of...just wanted to see where our relationship goes?
i mean missed kinda implies that i was going to ask you out and someone else beat me to it
i dont mean it like that
no
i wouldnt say missed
thats right
(basically)
haha
you have a bf
and now your done waiting
thus we have proved you didnt erally like me
you wouldnt go out with another guy and just forget about me
if you really did like me
and this is the way i see it
just because i like you doesnt mean i want you
your confusing liking with wanting
nat if you said you wanted to date me now id still say no
and you did :)
i've given up haha
i always end up lonely and depressed
w/e
either way your taken heh
they're like best friends
no i said alicia says SOPHIE definitely doesn't like me
what?
and you basically have a boyfriend
alicia says she *definitely* doesn't like me
i've pretty much given up on sophie
and this whole fucking situation
i hate myself
goddamnit
i'm slightly confused
yes
fine
do whatever you want
your basically in a relationship
just do whatever you want
yeah
you moved on from me to silverman in a day
nat i'm just a little worried
what
>:(
yes
all i said was something you did say
whyd you say you were insulted
you sort of assumed thats what i meant
you know i never said i thought you were using alex to get back at robby
glad your confident atleast
you said it
well sorry
oh
you did say it
?
didn't you say you wanted to get some really attractive guy to get back at robbie
i didnt know you were still upset about robbie
no
well than

well if other people'd kill to be in my place then i guess i don't deserve you
that sounded a little snobby
sorry to say wow but
wow
no it oddly enough doesnt
yeah i mean honestly love first off idk what you see and i mean do you really want me
well you dont really want me and i doubt you would if you went out with axle
and axle's my boy
but hell be hurt :(
yes nat ill date you
i mean what if i said
nat what about silverman
nay
thank you
nah he is
boy = girl?
so its like backwards?
?
or you are
hes depressed now?
and ends up depressed because he missed his chance
and so he just ignores it :(
but hes just not smart enough to realize how lucky he is to have such a girl like himm
but the guy even thinks the girl is amazing
and the girl likes the guy and wants to go out
and is so fucking gorgeous
who could go out with like five different guys
and theres one girl
and hes kind of a loser
where no girls ever like him
theres this guy
tell me if this makes sense
gosh this is so stupid
stop saying you'll never have a chance with me
next time i have feelings for you ill just keep it to myself :(
im sorry for being an ass and kind of leading you on i guess?
:(

yeah me too
hurrt
hrut
you were like
oh haha
don't see what?
hahaha aww nat
ahahahaha
spellFAIL
hehe
thats good...?
haha how was your day?
and not mention any of the bad
that happened to you
thats GOOD
i want you to tell me every single non-boy related thing
how was your day
whenever i ask you
two weeks
for the next
to
i want you
thank you :)
where your not telling urself your happy anymore and your just happy
then youll get to a point
and ill get happier; youll get happier;
all this fighting will stop
but if you would just make yourself be happy
im sorry :(
if you just be happy
im telling you
friendship??
for two people to get to that level of like
and it takes something like TWO weeks
its just that we cant go more than a week without trying to rip each others throats out
we have a very interesting relationship
yeah were best friends
ugh nat wat i was saying is
and best friends in the girl sense
yes :)
yay :)
Natalie I'm deeply sorry for giving you the wrong number. It was wrong of me...And you deserve better than an asshole like me. Your a beautiful little maid and your an excellent friend :)
Sigh*
Idk what else I can do
I'm sorry natalie for making you look stupid
I don't mean best friends as in l
you know what i mean
you do this thing
and then
where were almost best friends
but like we always get to the point
because we could be best friends
:) but it just makes me sad
ok Nat I guess I forgive you
haha
but I mean
that makes me feel better
well thank you natalie :)
fine
and sure
but trust me you found one...
that can make me hate someone...
there arent a lot of things
well i can gurantee you it wasnt fucking funny
yes
youuuu said he was hot and you wanted to talk to him
hmm not what you said on the phone
and your turning it into some catastrophe
To me it seems like you did something really big and I did something really small that i woulda thought is kinda funny if you had done it to me
It's not that I don't care I just don't see how its that huge
ok ill talk to Dakin
relax just a misunderstanding
i don't care
ok
want me to set it straight haha?
wow
oh
what even happened?
well it worked
nat I'm sorry :(
sigh
in hopes it might make everything better
thatd be like me calling someone i like a bitch
yes but thats not positive attention youd be getting
wtf why?
i wont even retaliate
so please
it makes me look sensitive and you look like a bitch lol
i literally have no clue how that makes you look better
:)
go ahead
your gonna go tell that to everyone in the school now?
oh really haha?
haha idk seemed pretty fair
oh
do what?
emphasizing the parts that make me look like an ass
and your gonna go and tell her all of this word for word
yeah well now she pisses me off ok?
Yes or no?
"Yeah we want his number cuz hes hot and we wanna talk to him" ?
utter the words
word for word
or did you not
hmm did you
simple enough right?
well don't ask for something you don't want
and make me jealous
JUST to piss me off
every single time you interact with a human being with a Y chromosome
you dont purposely tell me
and i mean
haha yeah cuz hes hotter than me and all that
annnnnnd im just an asshole
your a complete angel
hmm your right you have every right to be pissed
LOL bye
but alec haha
i gurantee once you know your gonna wish you didnt
eh don't worry about it
btw id get rid of that number if i were you
shes the one obsessed with Jason.
Logan propably instegated it.
I know
not really
and uhm
I get super jealous.
yes
meh
so I'd rather not hang out with her anyway
well Logan kinda pissed me off majorly
Tyler we gotta hang out. Bring Jason.
literally
yeah well the only reason logan ever talks to me is cuz she wants to meet jason
then whyd you ask for his number?!?!
but i never really talk about her do i?
eh i can see that
like Sophie?
who do you get jealous of?
?
I really try not to :(
I mean I broke up with alicia pretty much out of jealousy
Natalie I'm really sorry if I hurt you like that...but when I get jealous I just get seriously pissed off
I don't purposely try to
i guess thats fun?
like why do you want me to be mad
yeah see why would you do that
because i wanted to make sure she wasnt with you because you asked why i was angry and i didnt want her to hear it
y what? y do i want to know where she is?
oh okay
where is she?
are you with logan?
oh k cool
?

i didnt leave the house
haha no today was actually pretty awsome
haha
staring at the screen
cuz i love
my eyes are gonna fall off
from fb
5
probably another
and those five 1/2 hours were just programming
on three hours of sleep
six
i spent five hours today staring at a screen
hihi
SNUGGLES
love you
byeee
really ; ) can I see
why?
not much youu?
hihi
byeee
yeah sure
like what may i ask?
why's it confusing?
hwos your life?
mmhmm it was fun
yeah he slept over
haha best night ever
Jasons gone
hey snuggles
loves!
hey i gtg get ready to leave
just waitin for it to work ;)
yeah trust me these are all things I do
atleast till I get a gf...so basically yeah ill always be here
ill always be here love
well its your choice :)
yeah i guess i feel the same on that too...
haha i feel the same way
-.-
you and devany are like me and jamie
i think you're prettier than devany
in your case
or a boy
:(
especially when your the younger
haha trust me fighting over a girl with your sibling sucks
i know how that feels
im sorry =[
its finee
still miss poland
why?
hows snuggles?
back
bb
yerp
dads being a manbitch
gotta clean my room ahah
ok brb
and idk
and i figure theyre like best friends so shes probably right
alicia basically said it was a bad idea
meh
i still love you anyway :)
yeah ik w/e
that was partially jealousy i guess
the begininng was cuz of sophie and at the end was cuz of the polish guys
i'm sorry about that
and the middle too ahah sometimes
really??
good :)
even if you hate me
bye <3
aw ok sweetie
you cant text?
thats cool
haha see i count it
and just historically its not a good idea always
i mean i know you don't want to either
thats a good question
theres kind of an in between line you know?
but that doesnt mean all we can do is hook up
yes i mean i dont think us going out would be a good idea
thats totally not all i want to do
yeah so am I
but i think you assume that means that all they do is fuck haha
haha yes fuckbuddy
idk its just nice to have that kind of friend
thanks sweety <3
and if you think im as attractive as i think you are
i mean as i said a part of me still likes you
so weve kinda hadd a rollercoaster relationship
anyway
like infatuation
k well i meant the state of being enamored
hmm
welll im not a hundred percent its a word lemme check]
plus ur my snugglebuddy
ok and i guess seeing you with other guys flares up a bit of jealousy
would it be wrong to say your similar?
just because i mean a little part of me still likes you i guess
cuz of the polish silly
what about this week haha
oh really?
love? I don't know
jealousy...anger...enamoration...
and i mean weve pretty much encompassed over the last four years every single emotion two people could feel for each other right?
me and you have like a friendship thats preeeeeety much unique right?
listen
ok
think you can handle that snuggles?
just pay attention for like one sec?
this is just my logic ok?
just relax for a second
thats kind of a leap
what?
clarity is everything
as in you don't want to hook up with it or as in you arent saying that?
were you trying to say you don't want to hook up with me?
sadface:(
what?
?
im asking if all you want is a hug?
haha w/e
just a hug
clever
clever
clever
wow

hehe she's so weird
haha i know
but she still gives me waaaay more points than i deserve on short answer questions
*assignment
it was actually on like a ungraded assignmen
and he got it wrong and i got it right
and yeah like on quizzes Arjun and I put the same answer once
i.e, Mrs. Smith came up to me and was like - "Mrs. Dann told me just the other day what a joyful experience it is to have you in the class and she really appreciates you."
almost creepily so
she loves me though
eeeek
omg she is moody to the extreme
"I need you to take it today"
really the only issue would be if she's like
hmm i guess that isn't quite solved but that's a better idea
that's a pretty good idea though
or another free
but not adjacent to bio
and it's after break...
i do have a free
hmm
that's better than failing
i could skip wrestling
worst comes to worst
i mean
nope :/
can't skip wrestling :/
ehh
it's almost an unhealthy habit at this point
you of all people know i'm very good at bullshitting
leah
fuck
okay i haven't started studying, so that would be bad if i had to take it tomorrow
oh shit
is it like a double test?
?
Friday i was teaching piano all night, Saturday i had a wrestling match all day, and today i had to set up and then help run and play at two piano recitals
yo do you think Mrs. Dann will let me take the test Tuesday?

whens concert start for parents?
Guess who got his computer back
yo so i get my computer back in a day or two so i'd be down to set up some sort of thing in the next week. i'm thinking like a brief meeting in the next week and then at least one extended one over spring break?
motherfucker's offline
stephen what are you interested in?
good luck
alright i'm off to start my hw
also in the near-ish future we should have a meeting of some sort to get some shit organized
Logic, Cubase, etc. would be equally good if any of you guys have them
i'll do some research
and they're released to be application-indepenent, but idk to what extent mixcraft lets you use them
VSTs are basically plugins that let you help synthesize music
the prob is, you need VST support
mixcraft can be alright, but it's pretty much garage band for windows
audacity is...eh
Famitracker is fun too, for 8-bit music
but i'll look for a non-fucking expensive alternate
the best program to have would be FL Studio
haha i've actually done a lot of videogame-y music
well that's just not going to work
what are you using?
clearly, anything else?
any of you guys know what stephen's into?
well yeah that's a fucking obstacle now isn't it trey
trey did you look up any unity 3d tutorials
shhh go study
hehe np
:D
yeah i partially just said that to make you feel better
sorry haha if i could ditch the beach for ya i would
hehe woops :D

so some stuff will be slightly different, but you shouldn't have a problem
meaning like 2-3 years old
np, and they're kind of outdated
starts there
http://cgcookie.com/blender/2009/12/01/box-modeling-an-alien-character-in-blender-2-5-alpha-0/
gimme a min
but the one you probably want is
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iw5BPBJYDAk
starting with this
was this long ass yotube tutorial
the one i actually learned with
haha alright
where he models, textures, rigs, and animates this pretty sweet looking alien
huge ass tutorial
well he actually has this like
wel
one was
idk, a few hours long? broken into parts though
and they're llike
two or three tutorials that pretty much taught me everything i know about blender
there's like
haha alright that's box modeling then
how did you start it?
hmm are you box modeling him or doing like a plane-modeling thing?
whats the model of?
Send me a screenshot of a render when you finish it I kinda want to see it
Alright there's a site called blender cookie that has a really good tutorial and inverse kinematics. It's called like rigging an alien
http://unity3d.com/promo/unity4/?gclid=CL358Y2jxrUCFUVN4AodjS8AhQ
how do we do class evaluations?
nah
^ i got it
chips & salsa yo
The 13th but she's getting back late
good luck dude and def don't stress it
aight dude Game of Thrones calls me
yeah yeah it definitely helps, but like there are plenty of people with SAT scores 2200-2400 that can't get into a good school
like they get a ton of people applying with 800s all around just with no extracurricular life
well it's only a few schools that require them, and for the most part those schools care more about extracurriculars than they do scores
but like don't worry about SATIIs they really don't matter much in the big picture
ahhh, yeah I despise Princeton Review haha
my highest one was a 720
they're insaaaanely hard though
it has a few practice tests too
http://www.amazon.com/books/dp/1438000316 <-- this baby.
the Baron's book saved me
yessss haha like nonstop for two weeks before
haha no problem, and i got an 800 on it. weird since my math actually ended up being my lowest SAT section
oh that sucks haha, I just took that one too
did you do SATIIs?
I feel ya, yeah it sucks but you'll be fine dude
that was historically my worst too, I just did a bunch and eventually the questions start seeming the same
hmm that's a good question... I took mine a year early so I haven't seen it in like a year atleast
giant blue Baron's book haha, has like 6 practice tests or something
I'm saying I took one right before I got a 2300 and only got a 2100
yeah I get you, but have you taken any like, practice SATs? from a book?
the last practice test I took was like a 2100
yeah you'll nail it
how many times did you take it?
i think Helen might have beat me though
yep! haha. my first was a 2150 and then I just kind of got lucky the second time and was totally with it that day
second try, though
haha thanks man
Yeah no problem dude. Alright man I'm out, I'm sure we'll be around each other a lot more so I'll talk to ya later
Thanks man haha that actually makes me feel better. Helen's a catch dude I'm glad you two are happy
It was an awful thing to do on all levels and trust me it's the worst thing I've ever done.
I'll be entirely honest with you man, I went out with her entirely for the wrong reasons (mainly 7th grade hormones speaking) and then when people started teasing me about her I totally caved under the pressure and broke up with her.
And trust me, Alicia has a good reason to hate me, I was a huge dick to her a long time ago, and I've apologized 1,000 times but she still dislikes me for it.
She like hates that Helen and I are friends.
They are, but Alicia is super super freaking abusive. Helen won't deny it haha, and Alicia is a lot more mean to her whenever Helen and I hang out.
First off, right after prom she was being really really cruel to Helen and I totally freaked out at her over the phone. And she always makes fun of her in public, and Helen always just kind of shyly laughs it off, and I think it's part of the reason she's so shy.
Haha thanks man, a big part of the reason I dislike Alicia is because she is REALLY really mean to Helen.
I don't know if she's told you.
Haha I definitely agree, there need to be more Helens in the world. FYI, I love Helen to death and she's like a sister to me, but the majority of her friends kind of dislike me.
Well, people make fun of her for being timid? Or like over-enthusiastic or something like that when she's with her friends. And if someone is like being a dick I'll take her side and some people don't appreciate that.
Well it seems like you're both into it so I'm sure it's bound to happen.
People at GA are reeeeeaaaally mean to her. It's ridiculous, she's super nice but just too shy to stand up for herself when people are an asshole. I get a lot of shit for sticking up for her too, but it's not like anyone has a legitimate reason to dislike her. GA people will just find any reason to make fun of someone
And she's definitely the most under-appreciated person I know.
I assume you two are dating right? And I'm just saying that it's impossible to get a boyfriend at GA so I'm glad she managed to find one haha
Haha okay I will. I'm glad you two are working out, she really deserves it man.
She's smart as hell too
for us*
Ahaha yeah I was interviewed because there was a story on TV about her, and she's always playing for at school.
Don't tell her I said that haha
I can tell she really likes you
You Jess Helen and I should hang sometime
Yeah she definitely isn't afraid to say what she means, which is really respectable in someone.
A lot of fun actually, she's a really nice person.
yeah it scares me quite a bit
besides you

..
hey love
<3
but i'll be back on
alright ima get some hw done
hey babe how long you gonna be on for?
my mom said that my uncle (on my dad's side - he used to go out with my mom) lost his virginity in a drunken stupor to a complete troll
haha you don't wanna be drunk for that!
babee you're so pessimistic
like i've never heard a girl say they had fun their first time
haha dude your first time suuuuuckss
haha what's that mean
ehh?
mm lucky dude
have you ever given thhought to who you want to lose your virginity to?
rawr haha!
a lot of corn?
haha but besides that nothing
mmm me and you in a hotel in 6 moths with no clothes on
haha
Indiana
i'm serious
we should meet in the middlee
i think i could survive an 8 hour train ride for youuu
promise me we'll try to do something over the summer?
?
hey hon
hehee
haha alright maybe 65% untrue
and that's 95% untrue
aw mean friend
i like your profile picc
meep alrightt
haha alright hon <3 it's alright if you don't i wouldn't judge you
haha btw is it too far of me to ask if you guys fucked haha?
haha i know i'm kind of a downer tonight but I really love you...even when you get drunk and get with random guys
haha okay babe
blah alright
and stop ruining your night
babe i should probably do my hw
blah
yeah
yeah i know they were just reading some article about it or something.
i don't think i can stand a country any more superficial than the one on which I currently am living
like fuck i do not wanna live in Europe anymore
hehe <3 i love you. my parents were complaining and saying that as a country the US is super prudish compared to European countries
ooo you're right its 1161.41 from capital to capital. and honestly i think i am
and when i do find a girl that's amazing she lives 1000 miles away
buuuut nope she's just like everyone elsee
it means that the girl actually cares for me at all
that by assuming when a girl's best friend tells me the girl likes me, and when i dance with one girl for two and a half hours, and play call of duty with
ah i was just an idiot
ah i'm just upset at this one girll
i guess so
and i mean i'd be flattered
even if a girl thinks i'm completely hot...well that's awesome but
love i don't even care about my own looks, see
(I'm not talking about you, love)
and whenever i do find a girl that likes me they usually forget pretty fast
girls don't want a sensitive guy, they want a really attractive guy. if he's sensitive well then i guess they consider it a good catch
that's completely wrong
like when girls say they want a sensitive guy
and every guy i look at it is the same way
like i've never really met a girl who isn't superficial, that admits it
i don't mean getting married
and similar morals etc. but i feel like im just kind of like nobody else
and point out one or two people that have really similar interests and similar personalities
like i can look at any person realy
i feel like i'm never going to find anybody that's at all like me
babe am i weird?
<3
haha yeah
haha you know i painted <('-')> on the back of my super expensive richkid calculator

hahaha yeahh... she's not a very touchy person (she doesn't really like to do too much touching)
noo haha it can mean both things in english. Stupid people like me don't make it easy enough to understand.
i meant touchy as in "I like to touch"
haha oh i didn't mean touchy like that....

why is that bad
touchy haha? :)
she can be a bit immature sometimes too
and i'm kind of a touchy person
her faults haha? well she's not very touchy haha

we get to choose whatever language
that's depressing :(
haha pretty sweet i guess. by the way do you have to learn english in school?
pretty good how was your new years
hallo :D how are you
I'd totally take that class
oh that does sound cool, that stuff can be really soon
I have heard that... what's info systems like?
yep that's what I'd be doing
how do you like econ? I'm going to take some calsses next semester
that's awesome, Jess's dad is an environmental lawyer and he loves it
were you still thinking of doing law at some point?
also wait, what's your major?
yeah that was super cool, I had never gone down that damn before
you should go to Peace Rock with Matt some time... it's so much fun
the copperhead I saw is, but the one Matt and I saw I think was okay
super scary
actually real talk though two days ago a copperhead slithered like five feet in front of me
and assumed that it was poisonous or something so I kinda freaked out!
and I saw him freaking out
hahaha Matt freaked out
It's so cool you guys got to do all that
Matt's like surprisingly comfortable being naked in public
haha wait that does sound awesome
other than that did you have a lot of fun?
that's pretty bad if it can turn you off to an entire species
Jesus Kerry, that is pretty terrifying
hahaha what exactly happened?
really? that bad?
did you have fun? He mentioned something about some vicious dogs in Turkey haha
also Matt told me all about your Europe trip!
I'm in Puerto Rico with the fam 14th-21st, and then I think I go back the 28th
she and I just got back from four days with her family at a little cabin on a lake in the poconoes
She's a whitewater rafting guide this summer
Computer Science, and she's great!
I also went into the villages a few times and helped out
so they give the necklaces out in little villages, healthworkers give the vaccines and scan the necklaces, and they can update their vaccination history in like 5 seconds
they made a little $1 necklace that can store a baby's vaccination records
it's a startup that formed out of a Yale class for tech in a developing world
I was building a server dashboard for a nonprofit called Khushi Baby
but I'm very jealous you get to use your Spanish so much! I took some German classes so my Spanish is kind of fading at the moment...
a family made me a huge box of food for the plane ride
and of course the people were all wonderful
and as soon as you step out into the country there's peacocks and water buffaloes
climbing all over buildings and walls and power lines... totally crazy
another city I went to, Jaipur, was completely filled with monkeys - like they were absolutely everywhere
not to mention people riding camels and elephants in the middle of the day
but life there is like 100% different... even the busiest streets in the cities have cows and packs of stray dogs and wild boars
The part of the city I was in was all Indian people, so when I wasn't in the touristy section I was the only white person around, so I got lots of stares and handshakes and crowds asking for pictures
so it has huge palaces right on the water and lots of cool cultural stuff dating back before British imperial rule
I was in Udaipur, which is a small city right in the midst of a couple huge manmade lakes
It was like the coolest month ever
how's your summer internship
heyy! India was absolutely awesome, I could go on forever about how cool it was
󾇎󾇎󾇎
I'll talk to you soon chica!
😎 it's absolutely amazing dude. Dinner!
Yep!!
Today was my first day! I get a cubicle and my own computer
I can't :( I'm at this internship thing I'm doing
Samesies dude! Wanna hear all about españa. I was thinking about it a while ago but decided to not do one
Nope!!

dude how do i get ahold of matt?
Oo cool dude, that's always a good experience haha
Loveable
Haha the only reason I would ever do polevault is to make Mr Taft happy. He's so love able...
This little dwarf was not intended to soar through the air
I can't do polevaulting again
Oh god no haha
In my head id like to alternate lifting and running track but I think Lehman would stab me
I don't think so :/ although I'm kinda torn
No prob kerrles 󾇒
It's a computer-ey thing! I wasn't sure if you'd be interested but I think Matt will be there
true dat
haha I like that you took a selfie in a onesie with a towel on your head
Kelsey is doing a batman onsie
please god
yes! do it haha
and she randomly goes "Your friend kerry is absolutely gorgeous! I just want to hug her"
my girlfriend was just talking to me about girls with freckles
rock on ;D
no prob dude
remember to bring clothes tomorrow!
All but Billy!
haha it rocked, it was actually a blast. How's Kerry land?
Haha that's awesome... Hmm I should send some
Why couldn't everyone be as nice as you are Kerry?
We're watching a scary movie together haha. I think she misses you dude
She's nibbling on a bone it's so cute
She's 2 feet away from me
kerry!!
haha yes i can see why
chris and i met some spanish girl on chatroullete once and we were like waaaaaa
haha i know
punctuation saves lives: let's eat, grandma!
ahahaha
is it not storming where you are?
when you breed a lion and a tiger, you get a cat that's twice the size of a lion 0_0
yo you should look up ligers
mmhmm
Nín de huānyíng
if you know it then do Forest Whitaker - Bad Books
Capital Cities: Safe and Sound
you probably know it but it's my favorite song now
have you ever seen a liger?
haha yeah i was trying to sorta get at that but it kinda fell short :(

Larry the golden Zebra: he's fast, and he's GOLD like us
we should get one as track team mascot!

MY PHONE JUST STARTING SOUNDING AN ALARM
KERRY
there's a type of penguin called a jackass penguin!
whatabout Jackass Penguins?
like, don't they just look cranky?
maybe it's because i automatically assume anything penguin-like is an asshole
hmm
haha you think?
sassy, even
i feel like if they had personalities though they would be veeeeery sarcastic
aww it's a mix between a penguin and a dodo
aren't they amazing? they're like little cheetahs
http://seattlest.com/attachments/seattle_michael2/OcelotKittenDennisDow.JPG this one specifically
i was looking at pictures of them on google
when you said that
to be honest
oh by far
and yes, the wild Kerry is a very elusive creature of the night
at*
meaning they hunt exclusively and dawn
are crepuscular
like ocelots
some
a lot of them are
oh wow
be honest with me now
do you ever dress it?
elicits tears of fright
the thought of such a scenario, hypothetical or real
unbearable
or even worse, yeast riding atop a giant squirrel?
like can you imagine a squirrel riding atop a giant yeast?
god forbid squirrels should ever harness the power of yeast
okai thanks
you smart little acorn...
ahhh good answer

hey are you in honors chem?
My mom and bro are home so basically I'm dying
Nah 28th just chilling for now
How many peeps?
Oh damn yeah you have a house
actually jk
brb calling bae
good family time
lots of kayaking, rainforest hikes, etc.
another family went with us, so we couldn't really do anything suuper exciting
just did vacation-ey things
but it's too Americanized
which was pretty nice
I was in Puerto Rico
I didn't go with Matt and stuff
Hmm? I didn't go
When it asks you again I def would, can't hurt really
You should
Haha they probably understand
Did it do anything for you at the end of level three?
I would be
Haha yeah.
Phew... done with the first one of level 3
Oh damn dude how long was your cruise?
did you already get back from your cruise?
and I think I get back the 22nd
haha the fifteenth
And damn that sucks. Chris coming? I miss the dude
Yeah family vaycay
I'll be in Puerto Rico, why?
nah not yet
you look at challenge three yet?
trying to appease bae + trying to get EMT recertified + build a feature for Khushi Baby + learn ember.js + do google coding challenges
but furiously multitasking between like 8 things
yeah
I have this feeling level three is gonna be super hard :/
so I doubt we'll get overlap
apparently the base of questions is huge
nope
all mine are zombie rabbit related so far
how is it?
I'm ready to start level three but I won't get to it for a few days
is it the first or second challenge of level 2?
a zombie rabbit one, haha?
What level? They're diff for everyone
it should only work once
that's the link for the coding challenge
https://goo.gl/M4Iiwe
Damn dude I'm jealous
it can be done in either Java 7 (no lambdas) or python
and when you get to the end of the challenges, google sometimes reaches out to you for an interview
it's a series of coding challenges level 1-5
and I got to level three so far, and it asked me to invite a friend (but it only works once)
Also I got invited to this google coding/recruiting challenge thing called foo.bar
in Java 8, they added Lambda expressions, which are the same as Ruby "do" blocks
Fun fact, Java recently implemented passing blocks of code as paramaters
it'd be sick
duuuude make an account
Hey dude, any thoughts on doing HackMIT? Applications close on the 30th and the application takes 2 minutes
I still have no phone so I'll just meet you by the entrance whenever I get there
aight i'm on my way
cool, sounds good
still 8?
haha yeah sounds good
dope, I'll go
how is it?
what's it called?
ooo that's not bad
well fuck
Okay cool, I'll bring my laptop in case you wanna do some pair programming or something after
Yeah, I'll be home around one or two. When do you want to go?
Yeah, you want to work out today?
Hey bud I'll be home tomorrow before dinner, you still down?



pce
anyway we're getting up at 6 to go hiking so I gotta peace
so idk when we're going but you'll be the first i invite
babe and I were thinking about doing some big kinda loop in NH that hits a bunch of mountains, and we were thinking of inviting other peeps along with us
and yeah let's definitely do something
so irritating
nahh it's kinda like central pa, about a 4 hour drive
and It's a loop in PA, about 32 miles with the gf
just them two?
that's awesome dude, any cool pans?
that's good dude, but you're not working after alaska?
hahaha you're probably making hella $$ though
also jess has been asking how you're doing
yeah?? why so??
what's the name of the cruise liner?
or take the sis
you can prob always go out alone man
ooooo :0
alaska's probably sick
damn dude what for??
and when was that a thing?
wtf for how long?
I'll ask boobear
so friday might be good
actually I'll probably get back late thursday or early friday
haha you bastard, those are the days I'm hiking
haha will do
sounds good mate
and then kinda send a picture.. i had to give a presentation on it so I actually made it in powerpoint
there are like 20 different web apps that can do it, but most people literally draw them tbh
which, by the way, is a lot harder than you might think
once you have a good erb, you should make a git repo for it, and add me as a contributor
them*
yeah realistically it's kind of like pseudocoding... there's not a super hardset standard for it, even though people try to make tem
yeah true that
that one looks good, its a little over my head though tbh
http://creately.com/blog/diagrams/er-diagrams-tutorial/
and tbh i've only done this once
hmmm lemme see if i can find the one i used
but yeah I'm back tuesday night, probably will be occupied with the lady through the weekend or so
it leaves a lot of stuff out
also that tutorial i sent you isnt great
tomorrow is my last day in germany
dude you're parents are amazing
which seems like a good idea at the time, but occasionally comes back to haunt startups
often times they ask for 5 or 10% margin
ooooh yeah they're cool, a lot of those are sketchy though
thats familiar
(minimum viable product is just the absolute basic skeleton of your app... so enough to show that you CAN do it if you have enough resoures)
and there are a whole bunch of denominations of different startups depending on their amount of seed funding, like there's class A, B, C... idk how many but they all have a dollar sign attached to them
and that will basically go until you have enough seed funding to break out of the circle, at which point you become a startup
e) revise your idea, and start back at step a
d) try to get funding
c) talk to end-users about what they like and dont like
b) make an mvp for your idea
a) come up with some starting point for an idea, but recognize that its nowhere near final
its kind of a huge circle
so basically startups work like this
minimum viable product
unintentional rhyme
most mvps start with an erb
it has a bunch of names
entity representation diagram, or entity representation model, or database skeleton
http://www.tutorialspoint.com/dbms/er_diagram_representation.htm
when you feel like the idea is fleshed out, you have to make an erb
yeah that's a pretty good idea, so like a peer-peer kinda thing
ahh gotcha
hmm yeah, that's true
although... none of them are college-geared, which is pretty big
stanford assholes beat us to it
http://techcrunch.com/2011/05/11/marketplace-for-home-cooked-food-gobble-raises-1-2m-from-founder-collective-reid-hoffman-and-other-angels/
haha notice it started in india
http://yourstory.com/2015/01/tapcibo-mobile-food-app/
yeah does look like it's kinda starting up a bit
im gonna see if thats around
hmm so like the second one is kinda like etsy meets uber
whats that diy website where you can sell your shit?
yeah okay very similar
have you heard of grubhub?
also I think grubhub is super similar to the first one
haha right?
hmm cuz not gonna lie that second idea is pretty dope too, im gonna look to see if thats a thing
rather than cook a grilled cheese
Or is it more like, someone will pick up a Subway for you
were you thinking the first one more, or the second?
4) The rest is the same, ie Jake delivers the grilled cheese, gets a rating, repeat ad nauseum
along with entering his location, kinda like uber
3) He selects grilled cheese, and hits a button to pay
2) Bob opens the app, sees all the available online virtual stores in range, and selects Jake's
he has a cost for them, and an estimated delivery time
1) Jake opens a virtual store in a bubble this large, selling grilled cheeses
i.e....
or is it reverse?
3) Bob is happy with his grilled cheese, gives Jake a 4/5 star rating, and process repeats?
2) Jake sees the post, whips up a grilled cheese, speeds over, delivers it
1) Bob is hungry, posts on the app that he wants a grilled cheese on Park avenue, he's willing to pay 8$, and 20 minutes
so let me know if im getting it okay
good idea, but makings things very complicated
ah, a rollback-type transition
or fully in advance, even
hmm maybe paying 50% up front, and 50% at delivery?
so if a tiffin service gets a bad rep, people will either stick it out or just switch to another company. either way, there's pretty fierce competition
primarily because its the main method of communication, and definitely the fastest in big cities. even today...
but granted, word of mouth is very, very strong in India
its just word of mouth
haha nah, in India there's no tech behind it
trust system*
(couchsurfing, uber, primarily)
and sites that utilize a strong feedback system usually do pretty well on the trust feedback
we could also use oAuth of authentication so that people can sign in with facebook or google
so even if theres a similar type app out there, it'd be a pretty good starting point
ie airbnb, uber, lyft
Also, recently there's been a huge trend of web apps that utilize lazy people wanting to make easy cash without formal employment
So essentially you get wonderful, home-cooked meals delivered to you super easily, and it makes it very efficient for stay-at-home women to make extra cash\
and just plain normal people cook the meals, and people come and deliver them
the way it works, you essentially pay 75 cents per meal to get delivered to your school or work every day
I had kind of a similar idea - in India, college students and corporate workers usually eat via "tiffins" which is the Indian word for lunchbox
Noo that's actually a great idea
brb
idk start thinking of some ideas
^ allllll super important
4) how to do asynchronous stuff with ajax
3) how to interact with an api\
2) git workflow, github, project organization
1) rails gems, specifically the most popular ones like devis/railsadmin/paperclip
things you dont learn
haha thats why you need to do a practical project
how do you feel about it?
idk, something railsy
lets do a cool project
Pm
And I go to bed at 6AM
Or 11
Haha no at like 10:30
Despite the six hour difference, often I go to bed before Jess
People have asked me for speed
Right? Haha
Haha will do, some clubs don't allow pics though but I'll try
The djs go 11pm-6am
Haha no some friends from yale
I think we're going out tonight to a rooftop club
There's a yale group here but I'm solo
No they all speak English or German or Spanish, but mostly English
Australians, British, French, Latin Americans, literally everyone
There's also a foreign club that goes every day of the week, I went once it was crazy
A lot of British people
But like foreigners are everywhere, so every club is like half French, Italian, etc
Fog and lights everywhere
People are all on drugs
Super deep techno
Haha well the hardcore German clubs are insane
Clubs more, but yeah
Beer
Haha I never liked beee till I came here
Yep
Drink at work, etc
Yah it's different here though. My hosts offer me beer all the time, people drink from first thing in the morning all through the day
So 5-7 AM
Every night I've been out, I've gotten back to my house right before my hosts go to work
Haha that's me. Berlin is absolutely insane, I gotta admit, but India is just insanely different
It's pretty cool, not as cool as India but nice in the western sort of way
How's ror? Life in general?
How is it?
Ok Tschüss 󾮟🏾
^ bastards
I had to make another spotify account because they limit your abroad usage to 14 days
Mighta been that one
Actually I looked up some Martin garric song yesterday
I'll check it out when I get wifi
What is it? Haha
Dope. Doing a real project will be 10x easier then the videos, because they skip all the hard stuff (which gems are helpful, how to install, how to interface with an api)
󾮟🏼
With git and stuff.
We should start a dummy ror project to get you a little more up to speed
Alright bro Berlin calls me, I'll hit you up later
Hahaha nice
I'm virtualizing still haha
I'm too scared to haha
You gotta show me how when I get home
Are you dualbooting?
^ they do that so you can work on two ror projects with different versions in different folders haha
So it might JUST be set to the most recent version of either one in just whichever folder you're currently looking at
Be careful - with rbenv and probably RVM, you can set the GLOBAL versions of Ruby and rails, as well as the local version
3) in bash (terminal), type in "ruby -v" or "rails -v" to make sure it's installed
2) look for the command to set the Ruby/rails version to most recent ones
1) try to figure out how to install RVM, probably "sudo apt-get rvm" or something
My advice:
Okay actually turns out RVM can manage both Ruby and rails, so just use that
I think people use RVM to keep rails up to date, and rbenv to keep Ruby up to date
Keep in mind you need to have the right version of RUBY on your computer, aaaand the right version of RAILS
I'm about to go out so I can't explain super well, but it's MUCH easier to install a program that ensures everything is up to date than doing it all yourself
^ basically makes the setup 10x easier than it used to be
Hahaha yes
You have Linux?
Atleast in my opinion. The "rails g scaffold" stuff is actually kind of a gimmick/not that useful compared to gems and the more powerful features of ror
But a lot of the "magic" of rails is in gems
Damn, that's good progress. I think I got only halfway through rails for zombies two
Haha have you used any gems yet? Or learned what they are?
Also, how do you feel about rails so far?
The one exception to that is your routes.rb file, which it will definitely change
And it very very rarely will make changes to a file that has been edited by a human before (since developers don't touch schema.rb, that's fair game)
In general (a few notable exceptions), rails will only ADD files as the result of something on the command line... It won't change existing ones
I wish 󾰕
I can drink tap water here
You have no idea dude, like
No but seriously it's fun
Haha exploring Berlin, seeing where life takes me 󾮟🏼
It's like nonstop with her too
Hahahaha nooooo she's a fitness guru
Nah a distant family member
Haha it's nice. I love it a lot but the woman I'm staying with is sucking me to death
Yep. If you want to see ALL the names of your little internet-code highways, type in "rake routes" into the command line
Yep ^ that one
And it will then trigger the code in the views/index.html.erb to generate an HTML page, and shoot it back to the computer
^ yep
Basically, it's much easier to just give the name of the highway (in case it gets changed or something in the future) rather than the raw hardcoded gps coordinates.
You can just say <%= linkto "THIS IS A LINK", all_tweets %>
Which would be something like <i href="/all"> THIS IS A LINK </i>
That way, in your view, if you want a little link to that main page, you don't have to be super specific and write the raw HTML for that link
But the other thing about a ROUTE (you can think of it as a little highway between the Internet and your code) is that each one has its own name for convenience, the same way that highways have names
^ that's all the first part, everything through 'tweets#index'
First, it's saying that whenever a computer browsing the internet wants to go to the page mywebsite.com/all, the code that runs is located in the "TweetsController" class... SPECIFICALLY it's the method called 'index'
That's actually doing two things
Okay so the full method call (yes it's actually calling a function called 'get') is get '/all' => 'tweets#index', as: 'all_tweets'
Hold on ill explain that better
You'd have to look at the rails guides but I'm 90% sure that's the route's name
Yeah dawg, cya bro
No worries mate, please ask before you blow your brains out
password: yalesdmp
username: jemin.lee@yale.edu
one sec
Haha they're pretty rare
(and dudettes)
also rails has an incredibly tight-knit community, so you'll meet a lot of really really smart dudes
And shit like that ^ gets you inSANEly good jobs, like 30/hr kinda stuff
If you're on a small team, it's WAY better because you get better at using git/github, using pull requests, writing software tests
Once you're done all that, you should have no issue getting a good rails job
So you'll probably post some great questions on SO and get some good rep
Building a website start to finish in Rails is incredibly gratifying but also kinda irritating at times
I would recommend Bootstrap, since everyone's obsessed with it nowadays
Anyway, once you're done that, I'd try to spend 2-4 weeks making some ultrasimple kind of Twitter/Facebook clone with rails and a css/js framework
Yeah, the guy who teaches it is incredibly good, plus it's all interactive
Once you're done those, you're definitely not an expert but you'll be super familiar with all the rails concepts
So I would do the "Rails for Zombies" course to completion, and maybe half of the "Rails for Zombies 2" module
In my opinion, it's not worth spending time on learning Ruby by itself. It's boring and way easier than Java
I have a codeschool account for my student job that I share with the other student devs, I can give you the login account info
Here's what I'd recommend:
Okay, tbh anyone who says they're a git pro is lying, but that's good
Any good with it?
You familiar with git/github?
I use a linux vm, and use heroku for dev/staging servers
Nah
I think they changed their pricing schema, lemme check
Haha you bastard
(it looked a lot different when I showed you, i.e. it's much sleeker now I think)
Nitrous.io is great
Yeah, I used it for my first year or so
That one time I was at your house
I showed you on your comp haha
Haha I told you about it, actually,
nitrous.io?
and fastest to write in
no worries if you didn't... Ruby is easily the easiest language to pick up
any ruby perchance?
wow, then you're in great shape honestly
Learn anything cool?
I had an awful internship last summer but learning rails made me really happy
I could def point you in the right direction, and tbh learning rails is a LOT of fun
(Assuming you understand the basic concepts behind HTML, CSS, JS)
To be honest, rails is super easy, and you could be up and running in 4-6 weeks (by the end of the summer, no doubt)
More significant ones/tech lead jobs start at $25-30/hr for rails developers
And most of them start at 14.00/hr
Idk about Pitt, but Yale has a lot of startups and small job postings for rails developers
true, true
Haha, want my advice on the job thing?
I'm serious, I could definitely learn a lot
That's good man
Also, being 100% serious, I was just gonna say that
Hahaha positivity Kevin
My dad worked there when he was in college, said he met a lot of nice people
Nice people?
I can see where you're coming from
oh damn
Haha, kind of a general truth of any job, I suppose
Honestly I've always wondered actually
Is it fun??
Haha most definitely
also a programming job
You need it bro, haha
Okay we'll definitely go hiking
It's super good that you can recognize that, though. I think most people would see this as a small setback and keep chugging
Woah shit
Wow dude, that's nuts
Woah. Damn dude :0 was everyone there on shrooms?
Woahhh dude
What do you mean?
How so?
How was shrooms?
Damn dude, that's intense
Hahaha oh god, no, please share
ah ok
I think the best places would be either Catskills, Smokies, Presidential Range in NH, or Roan Highlands (a bit far)
I think bae starts really early (fourth week of august) and I'm not till a little later. If you're around, or even sometime before that, we should do one
Haha, when do you go back to school?
Yeah, I'm looking to do a few good hikes
Then I'm going to Berlin for two weeks, then back to the Philly
So I leave tomorrow night
Two more days :(
Oh yeah that would be cool, I wish I'd taken more videos, they take up so much space
vlog?
People are super friendly
Yeah India is very nice
Just me and a bunch of middle-aged men and women doing yoga in the middle of a park
I also just did yoga with the locals
But yeah they were like all over me. I was so scared haha
Apparently panthers come every now and then to drink water :0
Yep, pretty much
I booked it out like top speed
and I had to throw them off and stuff and they started growling!
and then a few more jumped on me, and one went into my drawstring bag
and a baby monkey saw me reach into my pocket, and he jumped on me and started climbing up my body
... so I bought some peanuts to feed the monkeys
and we had a crazy run-in with the monkeys
and there's 10,000 monkeys that live there
There's a temple called Galtaji
lemme see what it's called
and there's this one place
*Jaipur
But basically we went to Jaipu
Oh haha, haven't finished writing it yet
idk what it's called
and on one day of the year, they feed their cows till they nearly explode, and paint them
people have favorite cows here
they're painted
haha nah
It's just easier than doing all the algorithms by hand
Neural Networks = shit of the future
http://www.businessinsider.com/what-ai-inceptionism-dreams-look-like-2015-6
Rn*
Thanks bro, it's also 7:35 AM run
The heat gets unbearable in like half an hour so a short window haha
Alright I gotta work out, I'm posting about the elephant when I get back lol.
Com*
I have a pretty in depth blog. Khushity.wordpress.co
The food is out of this world
Yeah. India is amazing
Haha and that was a slow day. Man I've seen some beautiful-ass stuff, seen every type of wild street creature, even boars
Lightening, floods, killed winds, the whole thing
Then I got back home, did some work, and then literally in the blink of an eye a monsoon hit
So I ran after him to take a bunch of pics, almost got hit actually haha
And I looked out the window and a guy was walking past on a fucking elephant
Then went out, got four different dishes, each from a different street vendor for about 25-40 cents, got some stuff from a department store
Then I came back, showered and worked for a few hours
Oxen*
Yesterday, I woke up early for a run, passed a naked guy (butt naked) on the street, saw like 4 cows in the street, some Buffaloes, and a few of
Haha dude, I have seen some crazy shit
Oh shit nice
http://www.educatrium.com/apply.html
Nope haha
deadline is Feb 6th I think, but I applied and got an interview (no idea if I'll do it or not)
they're basically an organization looking for kids with good SAT/AP test scores to help out at summer camps in Thailand/China/South Korea/Singapore/Phillipines/India/Vietnam and basically pay for EVERYTHING
http://www.educatrium.com/ventures.html
Yo you should consider applying to this
If you wanna do outdoors stuff, I feel like Peru is the place to go
Are you interested in Peru?
Very Hawaii-like
Monkeys, bananas, weird critters, cool waterfalls
Yeah same, Costa Rica has rainforests though
Elephant sanctuary... Cool ass tattoo...
Like rock climbing on these water cliffs (3$)
Okay I was watching that guys travel blog for Thailand, he did fuckin cool ass shit
actually I guess it all depends how long we're there for. how long were you thinking?
I have no idea what living expenses are in Costa Rica
Sweet, how long you think? Also we'd have to check but the prices might come out the same
He did some cool shit there
That's from Thailand, he has a bunch of posts from there
tattoo
let's get tatoos http://expertvagabond.com/sak-yant-tattoo/
what's that????
is Nicaragua safe?
Oo I'll have to research there too.
That's how I learned about them. They also had Thalmic Myos, Oculus Rifts, and some other stuff
Right? Yhack had them for devs
Yeah call me
Yo lemme call you real quick
* price range
Is 100$ out of price?
Gimme five min
I literally have the fucking perfect way of doing that haha
dude out of: Java, C#, C++, Ruby, Python, Javascript, and webdev crap, it's definitely by far the weirdest shit I've ever seen
like "if" statements take the form of a function, same with "and" statements, "or" statements, etc.
weird eh?
(define (foo a b) (+ a b))
scheme/racket/lisp
}
return (a + b)
void foo (int a, int b) {
Java:
so if you define a function, you use the define function with the first parameter being a list where the first parameter is the name of the function and the rest of the parameters are the parameters of the function to be created, and the rest of the parameters of the define function are all the instructions to be carried out when the created function is executed
and it all goes in parentheses
so everything in lisp/scheme/racket is like a function that returns something
hahaha nah that happens to be what we're doing now but that's not it's defining feature
*
to
doesn't use any crazy libraries and weird technologies that you have to get used t
/algorithms
also racket/lisp/scheme is all math
It's a lot more simplistic. Haha they just do it cuz MIT does I bet
And it's cool cuz like almost all of the words in lisp are defined in lisp
Racket is a derivative of scheme, which is a derivative if lisp
So "foo(a, b)" is "(foo a b)"
Nah dude intro to compsci 😎 they teach it in racket
Life is good dude how bout you?
❤️
Yo I gotta go to bed I'll tty tomorrow niqs
Not really, a lot of bizarre stuff at the nightclub though
Oh damn haha, yeah they'll get better def
Hbu?
Very present haha

haha barrett would destroy neema
haha little one
soooo good though
like probably 70 lb
really tiny though
he's like a wrestling God haha
one of them is an insane crazy wrestler fucker in sixth grade
yeah
it's boring
I'm okay with that
haha
so she had me forward it to him
mrs negro just didn't know which chris kim to send it to
i didn't
you'd better come you little ass
haha no idea yet
:(
like they did to me
don't let the siberian wolves fuck you up
off to work
alright buddyboy
it's like 21 and 16 i think
thanks man
but he's like they're #2 guy and it was a close one
I'm almost undefeated in the inter-ac but I lost to this Siberian kid from Malvern 1-0
and yeah I won 3-2, pinned one, and creamed my Haverford boy yesterday 8-0
like there was a funny shaped object underneath his skin bending his shoulder
haha well not all dislocations are the same bud
fucked 'em all up
and one yesterday
I did beat two kids though
and I didn't really guide them to victory
nooo they popped it in at the hospital
he like stood up and it was sticking out at a funky angle and then he just let out this awful sound
it was fucking terrifying
also dude, Kristian dislocated his shoulder yesterday during his match
so are we just ignoring the part of the article about wrestling????
ahahahahahaha
haha I like that it's like debunking myths
yeah :/ he thinks I'm a nerdy
hahaha the bullshit about narnia
haha
now
read that shit
read that
http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gametimepa.com%2Fwrestling%2Fci_25089865%2Fwrestling-man-mystery-petrochko-guides-germantown-academy-victory&h=-AQHBcIoP
he actually built the whole game haha
the dude emailed me back
<3 night
haha yeah he's told me that
that's "GA's thoughts on Themed Casual-Fridays"
nope
that's funny
hahaha Themed casual fridays would be cool…ugly sweater not so much. Dress down days are chill. But yeah, wearing short shorts once in a while is a nice break from the system.”
thanks babe
and yeah that's it
haha i like that
haha you can make it funnier if you want
Themed casual fridays would be cool…ugly sweater not so much. Dress down days are chill. Breaking the dress code once in a while is a nice break from the system
it's funny haha
challenge GA
can i quote you on that?
good good
2. What are your opinions on having "themed casual Fridays?" Examples could include "Ugly sweater day" or "break the dress code day"
1. What do you think of GA's current dress code? Does it contribute to any stress?
could you do me a favor
kevin
ZzzzzZZZZZzzz
ZzzzZZZZZzzz
I took it out today
I love the fatty and the giant block
Idk Chris
And yeah
That's sick
Hold on I'll watch it
2 weeks
on what
Fuck I'll show you later
https://www.facebook.com/james.altschul watch the vid on this guys wall
Fuck haha
no
peace niqas
I gotta sleep
alright dude
yeah
CMU? Neil Ahern got in
like a royal F U to them
even though it's #1 in compsci and we could both probably get in
like I fucking hate CMU
exactly brotha
yeah and same with Umich
and better than yale
because there are a lot of schools better in engineering than Duke that you could easily get into
it's not the ranking
dude you're on the same page as me - can you explain why you like Duke so much?
haha that's because I wasn't planning on getting into big H or M&T
I weighed my options... And Yale came up #1
Yeah I know, it just felt right man
Yeah, definitely engineering and probably compsci
It's like playing COD zombies haha
But dude PFEW was fun as hell, and that teamworky stuff is cool I promise
which is pretty embarrassing considering the crap I give people for being materialistic sometimes
I'm not sure if my desire to apply comes from some deep-rooted materialistic urge to make gobs and gobs of money or by the fact that it sounds freaking awesome to work in management
haha you know to be honest
wherever I end up I'm good
dude I like Yale though
haha thaaaaaaanks man
>:D
hehe
yeah but its art and engineering
I think Merrill confuzzled the two
turns out he got into Viper, not M&T
hahaha it does noooot work that way
that's only a third of the acceptance rate of penn
if you think of it this way
actually
I guess compared to regular penn probably not
actually I'm not sure
I'd imagine a bunch do
ehhhh
40-60 lucky lucky niqqas
dude M&T is just soooo goddamn small
so that's high compared to M&T
almost six
yeah exactly
yale is almost 7, Harv is like almost 6
like 2% admittance is the figure that's passed around
they're both tough but M&T is way worse
hahaha M&T is harder than Harv man
M&T is hard as fuck
haha if I get in man
hahaha
weed + tyler = jello
dude that's bad juju right there
no fuck that
incense peppermints man
lots and lots of weed and sunshine
0.0
weed
dude you're a total west coast kid
U Berkeley would be sick
nah but it's like where its happening
Rice is a pretty sweet college man
<3 you're very welcome Kevin
there ya go niqs
At my school, the term “wrestler” is better conveyed as “Wrestler” due to the strong connotations carried with the word. If someone comments that the Wrestlers are in Kershaw lounge, everybody knows that you don’t visit Kershaw lounge out of fear that some barbaric form of horseplay is currently in progress, destroying lounge furniture and threatening passers-by. If your locker is in Kershaw lounge, well, good luck! The Wrestler stereotype (including, but not limited to: poor grades, social awkwardness towards non-Wrestlers, questionable hygiene, and a complete lack of acceptable judgment) initially deterred me from signing up for wrestling freshman year, despite my impressive twenty-seven-and-three middle-school record and lifelong commitment to the sport. I’ll admit it – wrestling bestows upon me a unique form of happiness that I can’t get from anything else. A kernel of anticipation bursts into a delicious popcorn of buttery exhilaration when a teammate defies the odds, winning a prolonged match in the final moments of double-overtime. Likewise, nothing beats the almost-religious state of “Zen” in the five minutes preceding a match, where every movement lends itself to a methodical ritual designed to warm up every muscle. My favorite part of wrestling, though, has always been settling back on the bleachers, Fruit Snacks in hand, watching back-and-forths between overly-involved parents and annoyed referees nearly develop into wrestling matches themselves. In spite of my athletic commitment, I’m more akin to the high school species that prepares for tests by making online flashcards (“who does that?” a Wrestler once asked me) and regularly probes the CNN Tech section for articles about open-source quadcopter drones or Apple’s newest unreleased iPhone. So, when winter rolled around, I signed up for winter track in an effort to pry myself free from the tenacious grasp wrestling had previously taken upon my athletic life – but to no avail. My cheap, borrowed track spikes felt restrictive and uncomfortable, and my awkward jogging form seemed pitiable compared to that of the lanky spandex-clad runners around me. Resigned to a high school life of locker-room fiascos and hostile glares from non-Wrestlers, I made the fateful decision to talk to the wrestling coach two days later. Following my entrance into the Wrestling Tribe, three years with minimal wrestling-shenanigans have passed, allowing me to retain my geeky set of interests while spending time with some of my closest high school friends. Despite the occasional jab at my aforementioned geeky hobbies, I’ve come to value my time with the team to an unexpected degree. My experience with wrestling has taught me that stereotypes are purely imaginative concepts – in essence, they exist because people believe they exist. At Rice, I see myself contributing a non-judgmental attitude that refrains from drawing conclusions at face value; if someone has characteristic x or participates in activity y, that person could be much more than a “X-person” or a “Y-doer,” but you’ll never know until you see beyond x and y.
I had to tweak it to make it answer it better though
slightly condensed
I used my Harvard one for that
dude you can mold any essay into that
oh shit that one
which one?
okay <3
just don't copy them damnit
I'm totally fine with you seeing them - I'm submitting my Rice app to the college counseling office as an example essay anyway
haha be a good person Kev
oh God
haha
to not copy them ***
to not
like I'll be honest, I definitely looked up some college apps online to get the creative juices flowing
haha only if you promise to copy them you little bastard
will they really help you that much?
I don't want your damn physics lab
you cheap little mofo
hahahahaha
yep
nah
She's not mean, and she's pretty funny though

"There are 10 kinds of people in this world, those who think this is joke is in binary, those who think this is joke is in trianry, those who think this is joke is in base 4, those who... ...those who think this joke is in base n-2, those who think this joke is in base n-1, those who think this joke is in base n, and those who don't understand this joke."
ahaha
Java and C were telling jokes. It was C's turn, so he writes something on the wall, points to it and says "Do you get the reference?" But Java didn't.
i feel like you could do some good try-catch ones
haha took me a second
just learned about that like a month ago
Knock knock. Race condition. Who's there?
reply you little shit
kevin
magic nigga
Dude she's a cool girl you'd like her
i can't really tell
haha no one to the right i think
haha see my gf?
i'm itching my back in that pic haha

i know
that I didn't do enough
idk got that weird feeling
did an english outline

i did spanish
i did stat
idk i feel like there should be more to do
alright

I feel all empowered
good girl. dude it's weird being a senior

Haha dude I'm at camp
Nopey nope
then yes
i don't see her till 21st
sounds nasty though
yeah i don't get that
No sounds bad
Herbs
How much
and that goes inside generics hahahaha
it's like Callback<yourgeneric<P>, ObservableValue<R>>
which is just confusing as fuck
but there's one called CallBack in javafx
and i understand interfaces for implementing event handlers and stuff like that
it's a ui platform
interfaces?
what do?
so now I'm just waiting for someone to reply me back on StackOverflow
well it makes sense but it all doesn't
like there are times when I hate coding
like who comes up with all these interfaces and shit
it's like a fucking generics party
< asdfalksdj<sdf <asdfasdfasd>>, asdfas<sdfsd>>
today, I have seen generics inside generics
it's intended to be as complicated as possible
JavaFX is the worst platform ever
okay not true
like worst fucking language ever
FUCK JAVA
haha thanks man
so is the flintstones about dead fossilized people?
...?
it's about an ad agency in the 60s
what?
it's soooooo good
Mad Men finale
dude gtg
haha that's everywhere out where i live man
nice nice

text bud
just sent it to you negro
you don't get it, your parents do
yeah dude it's amazing
nahh I need to get on that
hahaha never unsubscribed man
haha so it's been better
gone for three weeks
haha probably not worth it.
oh that sucks donkey dong
any new bitches yet?
haha Chris long-term plans always do
amaterus man
haha amateurs
did he now
haha good luck
what is it
they have not
i would probably lose my motivation
don't
yeah but i'm glad i don
haha that's public school mate
but no one was like offering it around
like at her party there were people casually smoking
like if you do, you do, if you don't, whatever
yes but they don't make a big deal out of it
like a week? dude just met her but i'm hanging out with her day after tomorrow or some time around then
like, a thinking allowance
that's probably 80% of her mental capacity
like idk how she remembers to breathe
and laughed
she pointed
literally my dog made fun of her
dude no one on this earth is as stupid as emt girl
she's suuuuper laid back
yeah but not like super smart
she plays guitar, really into the outdoors
lemme think
hmmm
but from texting her and stuff
hmm literally met her like once
kool aid red haha
brown i think
naturally?
raaaaaawwwr
yeah dude the hair
look her up?
naaah Jess Karpa
and if it does i'll ask if she has friends
i'll plunge to the depths of freshman pool with you
yo so if the current bitch doesn't work out
don't think so actually
not really
ahaha yeah he wasn't happy
we'll bring bitches next time
yeah def haha
Ahaha I got up at 1 whatev
were you functional today
brb
also frisbee and helicopter
if we want alcoholio.
no but we might need to take a field trip to Lehigh
haha nice Arjun
can't really find alcohol though
yeah
yup more or less
Molly Evans maybe?
you Chris Matt Kerry Neema Shannon Arjun probably Sophie and Kelsey, uhm
atleast
hmm
we do
i'm goin now
haha that'd kill me
you staying up later?
i'm heading to bed
alright man
haha good enough
and GFP production gene right?
lightspeed
like
real fast
they do
can you sum up PGLO for me
and meristematic tissue won't really be present in stems
also the vascular tissue is arranged differently
that's a biggy
well a stem won't have root hairs
senescence is like aging
that's abcission
wait yeah
like when shit falls off
^that's all
and ethylene ripens fruit
absicissic acid causes abcission
cytokinins induce aging, cell division, and regulate acidity
giberellins: break dormancy, cell elongation, growth
auxin: apical dominance, phototropism, gravitoropism, growy shit
think so
yo are we ready for this
that it does Kevin
yup yup
makes sense
yeah
that might be wrong
has enzymes and shit
stoma fixes CO2 i believe
yeah
si
or two chromatids bound by a centromere
a chromosome is either a chromatid
a chromatid is a set of alleles in a line
they CAN be the same thing
that was a question?
yesiree
it's a stored form of glucose kept in the liver
as starch is to plants
gylcogen is to humans
don't stress it
i honestly don't really know the difference
haha the two like centriole things make up the centrosome
centrosome is where they radiate from
aster is like a clump of spindle fibers
the centrioles are the two little perpendicular tubes
so like spindle fibers, etc
they're only in animal cells, and centrioles/centrosomes control the microtubule filaments
so it won't be on the final
it wasn't even that in depth on the test
yeah that's hard
they phuck me
like
the difference between all the parts of photosynthesis and respiration fuck me
they get me too
they're tough hahaa
man it's hard haha
this bio thing
freaking out
agh dude
i should look over the labs
i remember that
yeah
plasmolysis?
any cell will do it i think, but i think the pictures are usually of RBCs
it shrivels
hmm that's when a cell is in a hypertonic solution
ask me one
photosphase removes it
adds phosphate i think
how
alright what about Kinase
nah haha study guide
RuBP
hmm
nah dude mycorrhizae increase surface area
so rhizobium increases surface area?
that one increases surface area?
yeah
rhizobium and...
yo what's that other bacteria that lives with plants
haha*
i have no idea hhaa
i didn't know there was matching
really? hmm he's fairly intelligent as well
?
do you think it'll be hard
hmm
oh i gotcha
that's it?
can you explain alteration of generations haha?
the 3n endosperm becomes a form of nutrition for the zygote
so TWO things are fertilized in one seed
the second impregnates the polar nucleus thingy, making a 3n endosperm
the first impregnates the egg, creating a 2n zygote
a pollen grain has 2 sperm
it just refers to the concept that
yeah
i'll glance at a few
i'm not stressin it
did you study labs?
That I am girl that I am
Yes because I take Latin
i'm gonna try this sleep thing
alright
haha
haha where did that come from
nah i'll probably kill myself
this is awful
i can't go to bed
dude i drank so much coffee
best one
hahahaha
shantoodle
antoodle
shhhhhhhhhhh
shantoodle
you 2 huneebear
i never use them
making a study guide, but that's just because that's how i study best
if its flowers its ch 10
i heard it's not THAT hard
anything on that packet
yeah probably haha
hmm kay
are there really 5 adaptations?
haha wait found it
text me a pic or something
there is no page 340 on VLE
what page is it on
da fuq no its not
afskljfsadklfadkl;
okay tell me
just tell me the adaptations
okay i don't have the sheet
oh yeah
what are the adaptations
yo why does photorespiration occur more frequently in hot weather? i get that the stomata are closed then, but wouldn't that also prevent O2 from entering?
And Tuesday
Haha as I was sending that I was getting called too
Woah Matt got a special award
Haha this year Matt hit me in the neck way worse
Phew...
Yeah my cholesterol levels

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DmfNyGDyIY
do you like dubstep or glitch or anything like that?

Yeah she said yes haha
Dude lil Wayne just suffered a seizure and doctors think he's gonna die

good luck
alright i'm out
fun yo
in person?
haha what about freshman girl
he needs a prom date
haha well
which asian friend?
kk i'm going to shower then go to bed
knowing you yeah probably
actually
no
assuming you have the willpower to get back up
biologically, two naps
they love splitting
oooohh to split
then cytokinesis they split
telophase they become offspring
anaphase they split
si senor
si
perhaps
>:D
or in the case of Marfan's, Sex-linked Dominant
know what it means if a disease is sex-linked recessive
so
just be farmiliar with inheritance patterns
she'll give you all the info you need for it on there
not really
a place on a chromosome
>:D
all those things that extend Mendelian genetics
so like
and the powerpoints
si
therefore AB can receive from anyone, since it has no antigen, and O can donate to anyone since it has nothing that is detected by antigens
just as long as you donate to someone without your antigen you're fine
i mean it's pretty easy
you can accept blood from O or A
you have anti B...
yesirreee
she just stressed those two things
not really
like don't have to know the inheritance patterns
but we don't really have to know much about the diseases
yeah
5 in total
yeah
EAH
yeahyeah
yeah
haha so true
NOW
haha starting my essay...
true fact
like midnightish
we'll see
haha i might be up all night
whats the latest you've stayed up before a school day
although he's off now
trying to get answers out of matt miller
no time
still gotta write like six pages of english man
nope
alright cya nigs
text me if it's urgent
peace fool
alright
yeah
and arabinose is the other
UV light is one
uh
last question
gah you're lucky i didn't get off yet
good luck
you little whore
i gotta go
alright
answer: add ampicillin
is that comment stupid enough to warrant losing your k again?
the question is
it's not gonna last very long anyway
for now
you get the k back
fine
hmm
alright
like your stupid fucking comments
gone with the wind
it's gone
you lost it
nah man
but it's sad that it took you that long :/
what you said is right
you've got one letter still going for you
you're a stupid f now
you know what this means
uh oh
si
so in any plate where there's ampicillin and LIVING bacteria, you know that the bacteria have been genetically altered with the ampicillin-resistance gene (included with PGLO)
ampicillin normally kills bacteria, but the PGLO gene actually comes with a gene that allows bacteria to be resistant to ampicillin
alright
that's bad
soon it'll be just you stupid f
alright?
you lose a letter
every time you say something stupid
you stupid fk
jesus christ
ara is arabinose
amp is ampicillin
lb is a nutrient agar
the different plates
?
and fck
hence thogh
my u key is not working
you fck
yo stupid fck
and two are PGLO-
are PGLO+
two
no
WHAT
if you started glowing, that would likewise be a sign that you too may indeed have been genetically altered at some point down the line
as it always is...
glowing is definitely conducive of some genetic transformation...
well if they survived on a plate with ampicillin that's one way
though
if you give me a question i can probs answer it thogh
i just write shit down bud
nope
i was sick
though
i wasn't there for the actual lab thogh
wow yeah that is horrible
i handed mine in already
after wrestling all day, my neck will not move
alright
hmm
you?
talked about like my interests in music, wrestling, and compsci
and this year
freshman year, soph year
i did like
what do you mean
idk a piece of paper?
we can email our assignment right?
shit happens
yep
forgot about it
who else is in it?
yep
tomorrow last period?
haha nah dude by the time i woke up they were all gone
we just stayed up till like 4:00 talking and then the girls all slept over
haha no we weren't actually
Neema and Chris
Shannon
Kerry
uhm
John Dean
Lauren Cyphers
Ali Lynch
like Jen stack
i didn't know a lot of the people
haha it was just a lot of fun
and Matt's was way better than semi haha
haha i'm not the hookup type
whatever
afterparty
postparty*
and she left the preparty early
nah haha
superb yo
uh oh
you?
siiiiiiiiii senor
you?
almost done
nah little bit of english now
and i'm suffering the consequences now
haha Clash of Clans has got a hold on me
haha it's actually very important
it's the first step in both
nah
but the rest is right
glycolysis is a step in fermentation dumbass
glycolysis does not come before fermentation
what>
just throws it right into glycolysis
doesn't have to break it down at all
eh that still happens to me haha
haha yeah it's pretty confusing
Brady had to wrestle one
yeah haha they have a couple
haha how sweet is that
:)
FUUUUUUUCKAYOUUUUUUU
in the voice of Borat now
fuuuuuuckayooooo
haha fuckayou
i'm actually frightened
which i usually ponder deleting
usually a like is followed by a comment
yo i'm surprised you didn't comment on my new cover photo
oh no haha
preeeeetty much
cuz i'm a nice person
everything on chris's fb
haha yeah
yesiree it does
it's the output of the prep cycle
the 1-2-3-4 little blurbs really help
study the diagram
ooh so you're probably fucked :/
faaaaaa
megacircle
and then returns back as a C4 to repeat
and makes a FADH2
then it's oxidized even more
then it makes two NADH + H+ and two CO2
added to a C4 ==> to a C6 molecule
acetyl C2 via CoA
it's basically just like
and says fill in everything
so even if she gives the citric acid diagram
yeah
and i might review it once or twice before tomorrow
a lil less
i spent like an hour on it
i made a quizlet
i think more or less
yeah it's not really that hard dude
i did for a lil while
no planbook
idk
oh yeah i do
haha who is it?
still yo
probably worse
some people don't go with dates
maybe
not that i know of
nope
in the past
i have
she ditched Jack one year
actually probably Molly Magerman
nobody in the world?
haha when i was going through my Alicia-separation phase many a year ago
yeah i stalked the shiiiiiiiit out of him
where he posts Pokemon gameplays
he has a youtube channel
hahaha yeah i did too
poor dude
haha Tyler Delynn or whatever?
like Alicia or something
ask someone you actually care about
nope
-.-
right?
and when you get there she ditches you and hooks up with some other dude
and you're all happy and shiz
and she asks you to her school's dance
you think she's cute
you kind of like a girl
just imagine yourself in this situation
i mean
either way it'd make Nancy jealous
and if not, just have a good time
and if you like her, make something of it
bring her,
invite the girl to semi
is if you really wanna go through with that sinister of a plan
but my advice as a friend
not if i were you
well
if i were you
ehh
haha you should bro
daaaaamn dude
who'd you decide on?
it was hard yo haha
and the aster + the centrioles is centrosome
centrioles control the spindle fibers
aster: a bunch of really short microtubules attached to the centrioles
haha you're a fucked up little monster man
you're a sick motherfucker
i was like i'm really sorry man but i was planning on asking her
and i didn't literally drop the fuck word
he was really nice and understanding
haha stop talking about it yo
everyone must be
since the only person he asked was planning on it
he must think
like out of everyone to choose
hahahaha i know right??
and if we complain and then go right ahead and do it, it makes us total hypocrites
we complain about it all the time
it's shit like this that makes GA a terrible place
cuz it's bad!
alright, just make sure you tell no one cuz i feel bad for telling you haha
okay?
don't share any of this Mike Shangguan shit
yo
nah i said it nicely
don't fuck
that's what i told him haha
yo i got it all figured out
haha don't fuck with my semi date
haha fuck you man
he does haha
yeah
wow what a total mindfuck right?
Mike Shangguan just asked me if anyone's asked Devon to semi
this*
how fuckin weird is that
LOL
also that party was so not worth the things i endured
but yeah i hate un-punctual texters
eh
actually you're pretty fucking terrible too
i know i hate that
did she text back
pooooor Kevin :(
ooooooh dear
ooooh no
uhhhhh - oh
uuuuuuh oh
uh-oh...
did she text back?
?
how does that make it "all good"
texted her what...
no i see them talking alot
if he's the only one that asks she'd prob say yes
so?
no idea if she'd say yes or not, but he's a threat
what about Michael Shangguan?
they're together 100% of the time
doesn't Eli love that Jordan Sciascia girl?
yeah they're both in my math class
commit
you need to committ man
hmm
idk who's in that group
Eli or something
Danny Li haha
Austin, Davonne
idk?
someone will honestly probably ask Alicia
who are you going to ask?
i'm good
nahhhhh
shhhh
fuck you haha
haha god knows
nah haha
antisocial little nugget
ohhh
ooooooh
oh
if they're not going out they're definitely a thing
yeah i think they are
isn't she going out with Bucky?
Kels was implying that DEVON wanted to go with me
Kelsey has a bf man haha
"And was like hinting that i should ask..."
so she was like "Oh that's good"
and i was like Dev
no Kelsey was like "I know someone who wants to go to semi with you... who do you want to go with?"
and she implied she wanted to go with me too
and i was like Devon
nah but Kels asked me who i wanted to go to semi with
haha no my parents are alright with me skipping
but it's worth a test
i think it's only 300 words
Spanish class
like i had a tournament all day yesterday and two recitals today
and i'm sooo tired
and haven't done anything for the essay
nope haven't started studying for either
do you think i should just skip?
and a bio test
an "essay-test" due
well
and i have two tests tomorrow
and haven't started my homework yet
i literally just got home from doing shit all weekend
question
hey bud
haha sort of
also i'm pretty sure you used to hate Nancy haha
haha she's not that bad
but like sophomore year we ended up being pretty decent friends and we talked about it haha
haha yeah freshman year she did honestly
haha when?
no idea what she'll say but que sera sera
Devon haha
keep it on the DL?
i got new plans haha
haha don't worry about it son
it's alright i feel the same way
i'm just anti-Alicia
haha sorry that was mean
who cares yo
shoot
okay
go with Alicia man
haha it's alright man some of the people i was thinking about asking got asked
/wanted to go to Semi with her?
you like her?
por que
i fade into the darkness
and with that
Qiao mate
or should i say...
hehe ^ like that little pun?
ciao mate
aight i gotta go
i personally can't do it but i wish i could
haha people that hate each other hook up all the time
haha i guess that depends what you're going for?
she has a great bod though
hahahaha i know
do you think she's hot?
hmm
haha you and Sabrina would be a pretty great couple
maybe she likes you? girls can get defensive in that position
girls be girls man
she is a little crazy but w/e
yeaaah haha
big time
that's flirting with fucking disaster
baaaaad move haha
wait in the GA woods?
like that does not surprise me in the least
haha she's such a potsmoking type
yeah they are pretty close
what is it?
:/
cuz liz cannot keep a fucking secret for her life
...
and
...you followed her home
not much about her personal life
uhm semi well

Ahahahahahahaha
or generator
my computer?
and my computer
and my router
which powers my fios box
i'm using it to power my house...
generator
my computer
i caught a raccoon
poor kevkev
aw
light a fire
haha yeah it blows
haha i got a generator going
haha
oh
why
good luck boo
>:D
aourt aourt
go with the wind
good luck brother
what did you decide on for your project?
Matt is
nah
haha yeah i got invited by i opted out
have you gone before?
at Penn
are you going to NanoDay tomorrow?
haha you always show me these guys
which one are you!?!?
oh kevin
hahaha hohoho hehehe
yeah
haha i might goo
are you going on the chinatown trip
you gotta look
noo
whaaaat
they're not that hairy
i love asians
psh
i know kevingirl
i know
that's pretty funny
yeah
hahahaha
weird
ew
haha i would have believed her too
haha really?
sure
same with like TVs, stoplights, machines
use it
(which you'd better fucking know by now)
(like Android)
so a lot of phones
it runs really well on firmware
also
Redhat, Backtrack, etc.
other distributions you might have heard of before are
that basically gives your comp a desktop and a User Interface
the Ubuntu distribution of Linux uses GNOME, which is basically a software "framework"
the Ubuntu distribution is by far the most popular for users
(a version or type = distribution)
of Linux
now of all these miniature little "distributions"
any shit like that
make it better
so you can edit it, mod it
you have the sourcecode,
so when you use a Linux application
actually COMES with the sourcecode
but anything you use for Linux
so it's recursive
"GNU's Not Linux"
which actually stands for
which use GNU
and for all of them
Linux split off into 10230942830 different versions
so anyway
you gotta know this shit
bitch
shut your bitch mouth
basically means that anything used on it is more or less free
or General something something
the main being that it used GNU
Linux was unique in a few ways
which was a specific flavor of Unix
Linux was born
so anyway
interestingly enough, Windows is not Unix
but literally, there are thousands of these little branches
i think Sun made a bunch of server OS's with it too
BSD, Mac OS X, Linux
some, you may know
and it split into hundreds of little children that used a variation of the Unix kernel
Unix kept getting improved
then
kernel = what communicates between hardware and software
everything started at the Unix kernel
so listen
okay
i will rape you
sit back okay son?
let me give you the run down
okay
alright with that amount of knowledge you're boned
alright
is
it's not an "OS" in the way "Windows 7" or "Mac OS X"
but do you get like how it works
like obviously an OS
do you know what Linux is?
but i'd use ubuntu
any distribution i guess
yeah
nah
that just formats your .devx or whatever to .class
that's not a decompiler
also
it's free...
virtual machine...
it's used to run linux without installing it...
VMware or ded?
i'm doin that for my project since it requires linux too
and do it virtually
use VMware
*decompiling
you're going to have trouble decomplining
i'm telling you
dude
this is a dev tool
i get it
wait
the source code or like the actual code
the source code?
that's a cool concept actually
dat a comp thing?
i'll hook you
:D
family guy
actually
or will be, in a minute
i'm watching walking dead
make me
;D
hahaha you dirty fucking jew :D
you gay little sailor
>;D
;D
;D
he has everything
doesn't josh have it or someone like dat?
my dad probably sucked a lot of dicks :/
actually i have no idea how they got it
parentals...
the
from...
haha gift...
haha it was gifted a la Tyler
guess who's got some iPhone 5 >:D
i mean the sat
and i don't mean the SAT
are you taking the sat tomorrow?
for bio do we answer the questions for the part we didn't do?
which it was...
and casually checked to see if my charger was still there
to grab some studying stuff for tomorrow
i came in for five minutes
it
i went in today and got
matt was too and he didn't
it's alright
mah phone charger is plugged in
and a power strip
where there are cords and stuff
under one of them there's a little cord compartment attached to the table
there's a few rows of computers
on the third floor
anyway, in case matt forgets
but even if i feel better tomorrow, i can't come in because i haven't been able to study
i've been sick the last like day and a half
noo haha
and am goin back to bed
and i actually just got up
and i felt really crappy when i got home
well i have two tests
and i won't be in school tomorrow
i left my phone at school
nvm matt's on it
i need a favor
kevbear
i think so
that says you have a serious fucking hole to mend
like a message or something
and sets off a red flag
and it detects Cookies being sent in packets
and relays it back to the sender as an HTTP
so the spoofer makes an HTTPS connection with the site
hold on
and then resends it with normall HTTP
and then the spoofer gets the outgoing TCP packets, makes an HTTPS connection with the host
and then it tells your device that the router's address is actually the spoofer's address
it does something called ARP spoofing
so basically
wanna hear it
i think i got it
you burn me
god call me already
it'll take like five minutes
just call me when you're done
:D
no
so call me when you're done
alright i have a science fair question for you
Kevin call me you prick

idk
yeah
but then we settled it all sophomore year...
but she talked about me behind her back
the first year i knew her i thought we were friends
Devon
haha at first
i mean i'd rather someone be a dick in person
then it is to talk about them in front of them
it's worse to talk about people behind their backs
but like
so i figure why be a dick
until you yourself stop
you can't really expect everyone else to not be a dick
well
others will slowly stop
i just feel like if i stop
haha i'm okay with it too
i mean
but no
think how much we get teased behind people's backs?
haha
other races
nerdy people
stupid people
ugly people
we tease like

Jen Stack

like i think Ali Simkins is fucking smoking
well we have really diff tastes
yeah i do too usually
i would say cute
hmm you think hot?
if it's the friend i'm thinking of...
i honestly can't tell the difference
ewww dude my brother is hooking up with this girl that looks exactly like Mrs. Smith
haha that's you short on imagination?
i remember we talked about this
oh right
i know i was gonna show it to you yesterday i forget if i did though
have you seen llamas with hats?
i forget
do it
i don't think i got my schedule

and one 17 but she's taken
one 18
yeah
just all older than me
they're not all 20
haha sh
that's me
hahaha
;) yep
hehe
it's epic
and it repeats it in a different key (usually the fifth), starting on a diff note, so it always makes a certain harmony
it takes a main melody
and in a fugue
yeah haha
it's called a fugue it's so dirty
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipzR9bhei_o
if you want a song where syncing the hands is a fucking nightmare
also
i have my own girl problems in mah EMT class haha
you're special man haha
what'd you realize
then gradually increase your tempo
get it to muscle memory, then slow it down a lot
but anyway
yeah mine too
see
haha try it with your other hand
you know how like you do it so much you can do it without even thinking
it's the same as when you spin a pencil
funfact
in your brain
it's moving control of a melody from your cerebrum to your cerebellum
oh also as i learned to day
if you do it a shit ton of times
when you repeat an action with a hand
so, as you probably know
and if you're having issues coordinating them, play with a metronome
and always make sure you play in tempo
then put them together
and then the left hand until it becomes muscle memory
practice the right hand until it becomes muscle memory
make sure you know them really really really well independently
oh haha yeah that takes a while to break
for like what song?
that'd be gay
if it was ;)
yeah but it's not gay because it's ;D
haha gotcha ;D
haha i won't
*
you
haha i'll mention yo
haha i posted that "how to interrupt a parade" vid on my friend's wall
aight man i gotta go to bed
hahaha me neither
ironically i'm talking to her right now
dude i'm gonna show that to jess
ahahahahahahaha
woahhh it did
damn if i had the time for all this shit i would just go nonstop
wow that's sick
so it can do low qual stuff
it exports to iPhone/iPad apps
i mean unity is a pretty good choice
def not crysis
high fps
if you want like
let me think of a good low caliber physics engine
hmm
but if you really like Physics engines go with blender bro
you get a version of the editable sandbox
i believe if you get crysis 2 for pc
sec
gimme a se
yess!
and Blender
i use Unity Physics engine
i used to watch like thousands of videos about that engine
haha i fucking love that
is that the crytek physics engine?
what is it?
indoors haha it's freezing
we all look like police cadets or some shit haha
i have to wear a grey t shirt for my EMT class

Helen's good at...
although she's good at technique too
I'm really really good at theory and improv and finger technique
Alicia's really really good at sightreading
because they're all really really good at one thing
and all other one's suck
will tell you they're the best
who's serious about it
any instrument player
haha dude
and has been playing almost twice as long as i
she's also super serious about it
so how is she better than i?
but she doesn't know shit about grammar or how to write it
she's really good at reading books
it's like literature
haha
but she has no idea what she's playing haha
only because that's the only thing she's good at
haha she thinks that the only thing that makes you a good piano player is their sight reading skills
which is a shitty piece
like Flight of the Bumblebee haha
like there are so many piano pieces just to be hard
but that one's also pretty too
what do you think of it?
because i literally played it perfectly
but you can verify
that was when i was into her
hahaha
ends at 3:29
and went through at that exact tempo and didn't mess up once
i played it once for Sabrina
the one at 2:11
it's too hard on a diff piano :/

Catherine's Music Studio in Skippack

oooo

so if you're down you can come and hang out at the mall with me and wait till they get there and then meet up
but no way in hell i'm meeting two new people by myself
and they wanted to hang out at the mall with me

http://s3.amazonaws.com/theoatmeal-img/horrible/card_birthday_meteorite.jpg
http://s3.amazonaws.com/theoatmeal-img/horrible/card_tiger.jpg ahaha don't get it but it's funny
hahaha okay i'm searching hold on
how close to her are you
i'll eat you
but it was super busy and i almost got hit like ten times
yeah i ran for a while on a road
cuz i was running in the forest
and my feet actually
yeah same haha
and now i'm too sore to even walk
yeah i burned out after that much
i love asians
interesting
do you count one as up and back?
interesting
and went for a solid 10-15 min in the wrong direction
and got lost as shit
i went on some trail
asshole
i live in a park
cuz i got lost
but it turned out being an hour and twenty min
it was supposed to be an hour
yesterday
did i tell you how my run went
i'm getting it
alright
should i know any cryptography?
alright
continue
hasshhhhhes
like, as in, fine?
and you're good?
alright then
oh
that i should know
like ask me a network question
?
like what do you have to know about them
like what?
are there any prerequisites to that book?
alright how do i do it
find it
i think its on his photo where he looks jacked
on my friends wallpost
and the lines go up
where you comment
how do you do that thing
you must be really awkward
haha
i could do a 2 1/2 with that
oh since i can do the 1 1/2 regular
yay kevin
haha i tried it a few times with no success
is it hard?
alright so pretty well
what % of the time do you do the fingerless
should i learn it
haha
it is
so i got the complete opposite answer
and saw "decrease"
i read "increase"
was that
haha well the first
and got 4 wrong
i did the whole thing
nah
you would be sp3 hybridized
three single bonds and a lone pair
so lets say you have
and that's how many sub orbitals will be in your hybrid orbital
then add it to the number of free electron pairs
so you count the total number of sigma bonds
hybridization?
what punk
you suck
haha
you can do pandora for that
no haha
you just type in a song it plays
noperz
although its going to shit
haha yeah I use playlist though
"Where'd you go"
haha i love it too
hmm its actually pretty good
peace
10:30 was the target
yeah i was gonna say that
i had to help her practice spanish
haha and we went to the language oral competition together like two years ago
i very much am
or death-flavored sugar
maybe like poisoned sugar
there
yeah there is no sugar ther
and the bun is superficial hatred
like the love is a big hotdog
there is love
like at the core
surrounded by overwhelming forces of hate
love
like
Hate-Love-Hate
that is actually a pretty good description
with hate bread
like a love sandwich
or hate love hate
hate hate love
it's like
but it's not
i'd say its love hate
yeah i don't either really
poor poor helen

and she bites you
"Bitch I am just about to break fucking lose you better step the fuck down"

kevin
it comes up under likes
lol
pooping?
literally i looked everywhere couldn't find an interests tab
haha
how
uhm
feed
just appeared on my newsfeet
"Kevin Zhang likes pooping"
oh is that the public key private key encryption jawn
but never aysmmetric key algorithms
and i guess hash functions too
lmao i've heard of hashtables
hahaha man you're such a geek
do you know what you're going to do
what'd you guys do?
possible
idk how that's even...
?
lmfao really
woahhhh
very weird
i put something in my back pack and when i looked back periods were everywhere
my keyboard keeps randomly typing periods for some reason
danks tho
i got it
.
yo how longs our english paper gotta be
np
then he loses 15 dollars
so for example don't have a story where if your character fails
his sadness/anguish consumes him
he will never be happy again
a family member dies
like
the consequences should be dire
or whatever
or loses
if he fails
your main character ...
so basically in the story
"why is it so important"
"what happens if s/he doesn't get it"
"why can't s/he get it"
"what does your char need"
but it was like
i forget them
she gave us a few questions to answer about them
how their should be a motive for the character
she also talked about the short story
******
go die in a hole
also if you used sparknotes
cite them
i.e. cherice
if you got any ideas from a person
she also said
and the guy's actually pretty immature cuz he's trying to convince her to get the abortion
hence "all the things you've waited for so long"
like licorice
or sour
about how their style of life is getting stale
her comment about licorice was kind of like
that the girl isn't necessarily more immature than the guy
she said
she cleared a bunch of stuff up about Hills like White Elephants
oh yeah
lemme think
she said something along the lines of
for the papers,
we talked about correcting our papers and the short story
okay erm
brb
yo gimme like ten min
hermm
cya tom
gnite
yeahh i'm already dead
ouch
arent u dead the next day

dude go to the thing
dude you know steve jobs died?
okay
noooooo way
nopee
lol not a late night person?
i didn't get that one xD
ooh haha
which one?
hahahaha you don't think those are funny?
LOL i think it's hilarious
just trust me look at it
i thought you meant there was something wrong with it
oh hahahaha yeah but its a gallery of funny computer errors
http://atom.smasher.org/error/gallery/
no it doesn't haha
look at this page lol
http://atom.smasher.org/error/gallery/
nahh
LOL i'm looking at this joke site for programmers
25 in decimal is 31 in octal? hehehe
get it lolololol!?
xD
oh yeah that haha
get it hehe
cuz Dec 28 equals Oct 31
LOL no
why do programmers confuse halloween and christmas
i got a joke for you
yo kevin
no problem
so mac only programs
you can emulate a mac
and with a windows
a virtual windows machine
you can get
on a mac
ever heard of like yellowbox?
hackintosh
haha
yeah
with retards
i'm doing objective c and iphone/ipad programming
haha idTech
this week i have day camp
haha i would but i have camp till early august
no why
yo did you do your community service hours?
?
do you know any c++
cuz i was gonna have it print to a file afterwards
ooh thats a good point
loops probably?
nice
oh lololol
its like spanish
lol
wow
yeah see i know no calculus
is it fun?
hahaha yeah i've never done anything with cryptography
100 and like 65,535
ill try
and if thats not a huge diff
ill try 100 and 10,000
hmm
probably
so 10,000 nodes will be like 20 kb
like a String or int. as long as they all have the same size
and for the value i'll probably make it some object that has like one variable
and a value
which is probably an int
well each node has a key
but not by a ton
i mean lists will handle it better
cuz hard drive space is gonna be pretty similar
yeah time probably
hmm i think lists handle delete a little better
so they will be able to store data the same way
and i'm going to build my own
and its just the get and delete method that hurts
but they still hold information the same way
and much better than trees
*similarly
List implementations handle add methods similiarly
and an AVL tree
just like a linkedlist
arraylists store information
well look at ArrayLists
and the three methods i'd be testing are add(), get(), and delete()
and 10000 nodes of information
with 100 nodes of information
thats why i'd test all of them
yeah exactly
why not?
wait one sec
Binary Search AVL Tree
i made a custom
yeah
or LinkedLists or ArrayLists
do you know anything about AVL Trees or B-Trees?
or mySQL or any of those bastards
hahaha i don't know shit about SQL
nonon
*project
i think i'm going to build a couple of custom data structures and test their efficiency in different scenarios for next years projecta
hahaha
nice xD
ahahaha
or console?
any GUI in it?
thats great
ahahaha
haha
wow
oh
wait long doesnt go that high do they?
oh thats pretty sick.
crack ANSI encryption or something like that?
what did it do exactly?
hahaha that sucks
that you did last year?
yo dude do you have the source code for your science fair project?
lololololol great
its not like im going for girls haha
haha it doesn't really matter that much
rut ro
haha idc i'm cool with the gays
yeah i hear that alot about CTY
roflcopter
yep. you know anyone going?
somehow i doubt it lol
yeah haha i hear that all the session 2 girls are skanks
i did idTech
lol i didnt go yet
yoo
sweet i just checked it out i'll show it as a demo at our next meeting
ah dang i started a videogame developement club this year and we're using Unity as one of the programs
yo i saw on my newsfeed you liked Unity3d are you a developer?
I'm thinking compsci and maybe electrical engineering. My bro is a senior at Lehigh doing Bio E
Also do you know your major yet?
Heyyyyy yes college is awesome! How about you??

cya dude :D
ah ha perfect!
okay dude I'm off to go to bed
yep :D we'll make it work
University of Maine

five years from now you'll be like "oh well everything ended up working itself out!"
ah well everything works itself out
aw that doesn't seem too bad
how often do you see each other?
so it's mostly holidays
oh good point
I don't think it will be that bad
well my girlfriend and I are doing like 5 hours next year!

haha I mean for post-highschool plans
well where is he?

and I knew someone going and just kind of went
hmm well she was having an end-of-the-year party at her house
it's going well, my girlfriend and I are about to have our 1 year anniversary
yeah dude get certified man
it was terrifying
think finding neemo
we went through a swarm of jellyfish
I've seen some crazy stuff on this trip dude
it was!
today we were swimming at night and like when you waved your hand little sparkly photoplankton would materialize and light up the area
it's amazing
dude try it
you don't scuba dive do you?
check it out sometime
bonaire is awesome dude
yeah
chicken thighs to be honest
yep but it was very bony
like iguana stew
dude I ate iguana today
sometimes it's an asshole
haha sometimes
the coding part is strangely entertaining
it's mostly awesome
hmm I'm doing an internship with a company in Philly, doing lots of coding and making powerpoints
ya?

hmm
I doubt he'd ignore you...
honestly he's probably not around his phone
hmmm
boyfriends are annoying
so go for it
it's one of those "you-have-not-a-ton-to-lose" scenarios
yes
hmm
and you're kind of in the same category ;D
actually you two are really similar haha. she's like the least superficial person I've ever met
haha she is super cool you'd like her
she's like backpacking across maine though, so I don't see her for like 2 weeks
and I got talking to her and we get along pretty well ;D
so I was like, what the hell sure I'll come
and thought seemed very interesting and pretty attractive
and it was at this girls house who I had stalked the CRAP out of like a year before
and of course neither did I
haha well, one of my friends wanted to drag me to a party because she didn't know anyone
haha yeah I do as of like three weeks
god you must be so excited for college
I'm not bad at all
I don't help much
haha :( sorry
which is still, very sad
I know it sucks now but college will help you move on
that is actually incredibly depressing
and how far apart will you guys be?

i love you Jess <3
well i'ma go to bed
okay
:(
yeah
like it's horrible
but conceptually i hate it all
i mean i'll be honest with you i can totally have issues keeping my hormones under control
<3
it makes me happy that you said that
aww i actually love you
and i could not have phrased that any more awkwardly
do you ever get like sexual feelings?
meh i'm sure it is
ugh it so does
i would have been a fantastic amoeba
:( why couldn't I have been an amoeba
like an amoeba
whatsoever
no feelings toward either sex
i wish i had like
haha sex sucks
who cares about sex Jess
yeah same-o
eh it's fine
^ ex.1 of why i'm a total jackass
why is she having sex and i'm not :(
i'm more attractive than her
wtf
like
seriously getting to me
and this is like
my ex fucked some dude
gah
Tylers can always step in and take their respective jesses out to get icecream
and if the Jesses get catty
mmhmm
one Tyler and one Jess
for every six people
maybe
okay
and i'm positive of that haha
at all
there would be no human conflict
for every two regular people
one Jessica
haha if there was like
we should :(
haha i wish i could be like yooooou jessy
and i love that
are not in you
like all the things i hate in society
Jess <3
then i'm like oh wait
like society always depresses me
i feel so un-judged around you
like if i could just have my own personal Jessica
i wish there were more Jesses in the world
but with a guy it works backwards
it raises her value more and more
as a girl goes longer and longer as a virgin
well
:/
no one's gonna doubt my motives
i feel like if i go and have sex
but i don't want to at all
but still try to hookup with a lot of girls
and get rejected half the time
society expects me to like try to hook up with every girl i meet
like
:(
pth
like does that make me a bad person
Jess would you hate me if i said i like really want to lose my virginity
so it got better and better ;D
and had a really fun time
and got invited to a party
and went home
then i had a good match
explosively*
vomited explosiveness
got my ass kicked
went to a wrestling tourney
i woke up at like 6

they are sooooo goddamn adorable
do you know what a wombat is???
JESS
hmm it doesn't matter
i would
yeah
unanimously
but it's mostly unamimously true
and i don't like to talk about guys like a species
guys kinda get annoyed when girls make a huge deal of things
honestly
well

well i mean that's a good start
?
i mean do you see yourself having a thing with him>

SLEEP

haha same jessbear
for misinterpreting it
it's his fault
but as long as you don't do excessive touching
as in it's not always your fault
hahah relaxxxxxx i meant that in a good way
they'll always think you're leading them on
eh guys are douches
that's usually leading them on
if you really want to make it simple, if you touch someone/let them touch you
well that in itself isn't really leading on
otay
waiting
hehehe okay jesssbear
>:D
you're awesome
dude you need sleep
okay go to bed
<3
funny

oh
haha we should do that
haha yesssss
we did
and yes
weird
i said like 100000 times twice this conversation...
*month
...this months
times
10000
this "oh i love that too" thing has happened like
yeah haha that might have happened
probably random youtubing
oh and i actually have no clue how i found out about it...
hehe
in 5/4
i think i'm going to write a song
and i'm horrible at sightreading
yeaaaah haha i know same
i've listened to that youtube video like 10000000 times
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyaFgIqyzS0
maybe i'm imagining things
star, direct, and write the music for it or something crazy like that?
didn't he like
and the other one does it one handed
where he does it
and the one song
where the pianos are back to back...
like literally a million
haha i've seen it a million times
i couldn't find it anywhere :(
I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY SEEN IT
my fav piece :D
"The Time Traveler's Theme"
i learned the themesong...
i went on a quest to learn like a bunch of the songs from it
nooooope
i've never actually seen the movie
haha
YES
by Jay Chou
that's in Secret
that's the one
OH YES
ooookay lemme listen
hold on
there's one i always knew that sounded like it could be
hmm
oh
like i know a kid's one
is it easy or hard?
it's just awesome
so if you slide down the black keys in the middle of a song
with the black keys
you can hit all the pentatonic notes of it
the cool part is
but ready
it's kinda hard
I really really really like playing in F# major
because like Fm/Ab are easy and sound good to me
and i guess obviously B either
idk it's just not a key i'm very attracted to
well Abm
Ab
i like never play in like
hahaha we are the same
weeeeeeird
that's my fav key
:D
same haha
woah
what key did you start in?
and i do it a loooooot haha
but still really good...
how'd it go?
my grandmother was agape :D

or try new things
or travel
the reason we work hard is so we can have families
if the answer's yes then i think that's a good reason to stay alive
have you ever wanted to be here?
i mean
but that doesn't mean we shouldn't be here
maybe we're not really here for a reason
alright well think of it this way
oh
then it's not too broad
i mean if it's actually life you have a problem with
if i'm getting what you're trying to say
that's rather broad
what's wrong
:(
you sure your doing alright?
i'm pretty good
how are you :D
jessicaaa
honestly i think the reason i asked her out anyway was that i just really wanted to be in a relationship
yeahh i wasn't
so yeah
cuz she had a boyfriend like a year ago
that she really likes me but she's not ready to date again
and then today she texts me and says
yesterday i was like "hey wanna hang out this weekend?" and she's like sure
and went to semi with
anyway, the girl that i've been sort of on and off flirting with for a few months
blah sorry i totally forgot i was in a convo
apparently she really likes me but isn't ready to date again...
:/
blah hon i just got turned down
oh damn that's horrible :(
i'm so sorry!
oh my god!!
besides the one i dated
noo :( the one person that knew her has no other mutual friends named alicia
yeahh haha i like the name
haha
yess i did
hehe ill see if i can find her
remember i thought you looked like an alicia
idk i didn't talk to her hehe
HOW WEIRD IS THAT???
AND HER NAME WAS ALICIA
at first i thought it was you and i was like holy crap
and there was a girl that visited my school that looked exactly like youu!!!!
:D enjoyed your wallpost
jessbearr
hahaha why do you think its so atttractive to you
be the next superstar skater
intense haha
wow
haha i love you
eh please wait a little while???
yes then go to a salon
i have this rule about not making big decisions when im not in the right mindset
nooooO!
start watching the office
don't!!!!!!!
sure hehe ;)
"The Outcast"
and the episode is
its on the series Star Trek: Voyager
hey i found the name of the episode
wait what are you asking in the first part
okay
eh who cares
hmm i wonder how relevant that is to this scenario
you should watch it haha
and she tells her new lover (who's a main character on the show) that she feels so much better this way
like everyone else
that makes her asexual
and they give her an operation
and she gets captured
but then the aliens pass some law or something
and she convinces him that she'd much rather be heterosexual than asexual
and one of the main characters falls in love with one of the aliens
that were all heterosexual
and so there was this super small subsociety of maybe like a few hundred aliens on this planet
and they'd be shunned
that's heterosexual
there would be one that is born
but every once in a while
and they all lived peacefully
and everyone in the alien society was asexual
where there was this alien society
there was an episode
have you ever watched star trek?
i mean i'm sort of glad i'm not the only one that's fed up with this terrible society we exist as a part of -.-
i think you just need to find more weird peoplee
but not always really
well from an objective perspective, being bitter does tend to make people avoid you
what's wrong in your world
i've been that alot too recently
nooo

<3
hahaha
haha you changed yours too
but which is which?!?!
one's edible and the other's a sentient life form
aww a sandwich isn't a person jess :)
not for a sandwich
if you were a sandwich i'd eat you
jesssssie
doop
i can't sleeeeep
how are you
you toooo :D
hey jesss
:)
that i just got
i think i spent five hours on one math problem
i got ittt
brooo
sucksss
how was your day
me too
yah
doesn't work
BAM
on the 21st term
and then randomly
20 terms
and it works for like
and i've tried like a million things
that i have to figure out
this pattern
there's like
that's pissing me off
it's all math
i haven't done a single line of code tonight
that's a lie
actually
science fairr
borderline about to eat my keyboard
like
im in a programming rage
its coool
HI
<3 byeeee
i get up at like 4:30 for a wrestling tourney
gah i wish i could talk more but i have to go to bed
heyyy
you pumped ?
OMG YOU TOO
goood :)
how've you been?
merry christmas eve :)
hmm its okay
would that be horrible to make eggdrop soup from beefstock?
and i gtg
so its caught in a vicious loop
so she keeps trying to pay more attention to me
but she thinks im pissed at her because shes not paying me any attention
so i won't like her anymore
like i try to not talk to her
the asian one
Alicia
i'm trying to ignore the ex girl
the thing is
yeah
i figure when i go out with kelsey ill probably forget about her
yah
she has a bf
ive been thinking about it a lot
idk
yeah
hey i think i really deep down still like my ex
i have to go btw
yeah i guess
and this was before i was committed to this girl
do you know any girls like that
very atypical for a girl by the way
and that majorly bothers me
and not the whole lovey part
she basically just wants to bang
but she's like the total opposite
and there's another girl that i sort of wanted to have a thing with
it's like she has 100% what she wants
so it's not like were meeting in the middle haha
than she'd be having it her way basically
touchy
and if we just talked and did nothing
and be really happy
or have an emotional and physical connection with someone else
wich is i guess half what i want
well i could have just an emotional connection with her
i have to go at 1 15 btw
sure
i just don't think it'd be wrong to break off a relationship because our views on the "physical part" differ
yeah
and most girls would say "oh if that's what he means, i'm down with that"
thats physical
like curling up to watch a movie
and by physical i don't mean literally just fucking
it's a little weird, ya
i enjoy that a lot
and that's intimate
were not being physical at all
haha
like online
i play videogames with kelsey all the time
i said as intimate
clarify what specifically
it probably won't work out
if they don't want to have either one of those
they're both really important for me
there's the emotional part and the physical part
same way without the emotional part it's not intimate
i guess its not as intimate?
just without being physical
you can be intimate without being physical
i didn't say that
no its to reach a goal of intimacy
honestly that would probably bother me even more
if she never wanted to anything BUT get physical i'd break it off too
but it's just something that's important to me
and i don't want to go into it just for physical action
i'm not using her
but do you think it'd be wrong of me to break off a relationship with her because she didn't want to do anything physical with me?
yeah i won't
so i guess we both care about that physical intimacy just as much
i'm confused
haha so you don't care about it as long as you get your way ?
would you do things with a guy that you really liked?
and for you its really important that its not
the only difference is for me its really important that its there
it seems from my perspective lust is just as important to you as it is to me
*doesn't
so to say that lust is only a small part of love idoesn't seeem right
i mean evolutionarily that's really the only reason love exists
it's not just like some unimportant thing
but i think you can't label 'lust' as a facet
but more than anyone else
not a huge amount
i like her
nice guy
you two went out and he was completely fine with not doing anything physical whatsoever?
do you think he would be okay with going out with you if you didn't do anything physical
they probably won''t either
if one loves sex and the other doesnt
if one person likes movies and another hates movies they prob won't get along
why? it's part of their personality just as much as anything else
makeout, hookup, yadda yadda
or anything like that
that it's not bad at all for someone to want to have sex
no i'm just saying
whereas we can live without sex technicalyl
i mean the only difference between lust, and say "thirst" is that thirst targets something that we need to survive
but so does a lot of things...
yeah it does do that
i don't think you should look down on those who feel it stronger than others
jess i think you have to realize that lust is like a part of human nature
yeah haha
haha i told u i just got that vibe
not yet
haha not to me
idk i get the vibe she doesnt do the making out thing
like i'll come right out and say it haha
she's not very touchy
maybe haha
like a mont hor so
the one im goin to semi with
my lova is kelsey
oh yeah i stopped talking to her after a day
oh her?
haha prob a different one
was something wrong befo?
haha were going to semi together
its like 215 or something
yeah i feel yea
eh that's not bad
what'd you get?
mehhh
okay youu?
no its fine :)
:( get better
meh i gtg jess
at some point
that's basically everyone
no?
okay then go to bed
you're a really complex person
you're not a terrible person jess
im here for you
what about me jess?
oh hush jess
it's physically impossible
i can't actually
nope
you're caught in a vicious circle jess
aww your not a dementor
have you ever heard someone say "I wish i had committed suicide"
it does
contemplation of suicide usually goes in hand in hand with that
understandable
you need to be more positive
nooo you're just being negative
no stop i hate being most people
hush hush hush you have my attention
im talking to you right now
no im done my hw
and meh i feel horrible now
sorry
sorry
omg
NOO
what did they say?
please
just keep doing thatt
stop being depressed
tell me something good that happened to you today
hows your life been going
hey der girlll
yeah i miss you too :(
gnitee
yeah :) i have you to thank for that
bleh i gtta go
if the persones way more attractive (or less)
but its like hard to start a relationship
yeah i agree
but certainly at the beginning they do
and i guess looks don't matter later on
i think a lot of them end up that way
idk
bleh i wanna believe you
yeah it always is but i think its usually trumped by looks
but they turn down everybody less attractive then themselves
because they're not attractive enough
when they don't get a boy or girl
everybody's upset
but everybody's a walking contradiction
oh yeah they do
wow i love that you think that way
can i stalk him?
who was it?
im gonna go to bed
idk im sorry
its not a good enough reason to change it though
yah
you look pretty in it but i don't like it
yeah i just finished my hw
but i am not really sure
i think you're a lot prettier
ima go to bed
ah i don't feel good
?
Alicia Lu
gah fine
like seven back
im with an asian girl and guy'
nvm a way back
shes in my profile pic like two ago
haha jk there are more than two but were only referencing her
-.-
haha two
thats still a diff girl
no diff girl
it's not even over yet though
meh
yeah
people are just asses
yeah
and we didn't talk for a while
we just fell apart
and eventually i think the pressure caused so many problems
yeah
and i was going out with an asian girl
but i got bullied alooooot cuz i was really small
we were like the perfect couple
we went out in 7th grade
yea hahah
but this girl...
but then after like a week i was like nah they're really diff
well at first you really reminded me of her
aw you do
blah a girl i used to like a lot
i'm not being figurative you actually look a lot like another girl
eh you kinda look like someone i wanna forget in it
yep np
yeah i left out all the stuff that would gross you out
yeah i can understand how that's gross from your perspective
anddd from there you can probably puzzle it together
scenario
"what would you do if you were with me"
and it got to the
and then i think we were asking questions
being horny or something?
and then maybe it got to like
i think we were just talking normally
nooo haha
but it's a little more involved haha
basically that over phone
sexting or phonesex?
about which
rofl
actually i had phonesex once too
hahah wellllll
lmao sorry
oh that's not that bad i've done that
sexting is supposed to be with pics haha
"i'd scream and call the cops and cry"
be like
hehe
yess
that takes like a second to type
something longerrr
that would make me cry inside haha
"lol"?
haha you're so dull
ahahaha
what?!?
uh oh
yesss go ahead
i like that feeling of capturing someone's despair
yeah i think that might be my favorite movie
did you ever watch Real Time?
ahaha its a scary movie
fine "affectionate title for a friend" watch Insidious
how was yours love
i was wrestling all day
bleh
hi jess (:
haha thanks (:
<3 gnite
i love youuu and i wish you would see your awesome
i gtg jess
Song is forever young
stood up and started singing
then everyone in our house (we have houses like gryffindor in harry potter)
then they all came back in
then the guitar and violin dropped out
then guitar and violin
then the drums came in
then the girl came in
actually first it was just me
at first it was just me and the girl
it was cool
and there were 6 acts and we got first
and a girl was singing
i was playing the piano
yeahh
we got first in the talent show
whatever
yeah
i figured he wouldnt understand the SAT thing
i told him i was at my aunts
SAT class
hehe whoops
i skipped a tourney
unless you wanna change the subject
but MEH none of that matters
he was being an ass
except for my wrestling coach made me leave wrestling for today and tomorrow
it's all good i had a great day
if theres such a thing as "good" freaky
not freaky
i'd say different
i could never give up on you
it matter so much
yes it does
no its nott
i wish i could be more helpful
gah
honestly jess i wish i could be more like you
don't be sorry
:( you're amazing
and would make a great song
that rhymes
gahh jess i wish you could see you the way i do :(
i hate putting it this way but i feel like your parents accidently brainwashed you into thinking everything's your fault
now that i think of it i've never met a mentally handicapped asian person
and you were mentally slow they would still love you
jess if they were good parents
so have you!
jess you really need to realize its not your fault its your parents
you should be upset because someone else is making a bad mistake
jess fuck your parents
and jess you changed my life can you atleast be proud of that?
you're one of the most fun people i know
i look up to you hugely
you've made more impact on my life in such a short time than anybody else ever
jess your not a dissapointment
jess chill your grill of a second
jess stop
jess your not a dissapointment
how are you a dissapointment?
no reason number one is they don't get along
there are a gajillion things causing your parents pain
even
jess you're not the source
*yourself
so don't blame yourslef
so the fault is all theirs
and they're completely responsible
had complete control over whether or not they wanted to have a baby
your parents however
your not to blame at all
and since you had a huge effect, but no control
the only people that had control there were your parents
you weren't the one that decided you would be born
but that doesn't make it your fault
so while yes, if you didnt exist, perhaps your parents would be happier
fault = (how much you caused something) * (how much control over it you have)
so what you should get out of this is
because they didnt know WWII was going to happen
but its not
"WWII is Hitler's parent's fault"
so initially one would say
WWII could have arguably been avoided
if they had never had a kid
Hitlers parents
so example
it's just as much how much control that person, or entity had
but causality isnt the only factor of blame and fault
granted sometimes it is
no
but does that mean it's to blame for it?
right?
it would cause another outcome, different from the already preexisting outcome
didn't exist
something intangible perhaps
someone,
if something
so
this is a little bit of an abstract thought so bear with me?
okay
jess
do you really feel like its your fault?
i wish there was something i could do
i'm sorry :(
and does that even make it the kids fault?
do you really think having kid can tear a loving couple apart?
stop blaming yourself jess
no you don'tt it's not your fault
if you were a booger i'd pick you first
jesss
you should go make waffles
jesss
aw :(
why are they angry
blah
play chess
don't think about it
i feel bad
haha im sowwy
ahahah
haha why?
jess did you call me?

Geoff Jess
theres a kid at my school
yess they doo
mmhmm :)
(but it's really about me and you)
and i was really harsh and he hated me but then he got really happy cuz people started liking him
i sorta twisted it and said i had a friend named jeff who had really low confidence and self esteem
yepp i wrote about me and you as an example
"Should friends be honest with each other, even if the truthful comment could be hurtful?"
with the prompt
turns out my SAT homework is to write an essay
fate has like weird ways of working into our everyday lives?
okay so you know how like
just being brutally honest
i don't think you were trying to be mean
ahh we're both kinda at fault
yeah me too i kinda flipped :(
yes it is very very weird
no you weren't
i was being a bitch the other day
ever said to me
meanest thing someone has
actually i think that's the
yeah that was pretty bad
before i say something i regret
i'll talk to you tomorrow jess
haha i think you are so used to hearing me complain about not getting girls that you assume that's what my problem is
i'm over all that crap
and all that stuff
meeting girls
i know i'm attractive and i have no problem like
no listen to me
any girl will always ditch me for a more attractive guy
maybe i just haven't found the right girl yet
hard to say
alsdfkh
hmm
it's like
well
sorta
hi jesssss
well i gtg
atleast for me ahah
if you don't try to get girls you won't get any
the great thing about being a guy is
i wouldn't tell anyone
bleh
being asexual*
but seriously it would be awesome
jk <3
ahahaha
we could have like an asexual relationshipp
i wanna be asexuall
like not get attached
atleast not admit it
intimately
guys aren't supposed to feel like
i don't make a good boy do i?
that's a huge part of it too
they will mean more to me then i mean to them
to any girl
i just feel like
ik you are
by physical attachment i meant more emotional
i feel like i can't be happy without that physical interaction but i can't be happy with it
it's like
honestly
i hate that i want to hook up at all
no i hate it too
especially when they make it seem like there is a physical attachment
but it really bothers me that people can do that without physical attachment
like instinctively i want to like hook up or do whatever
i have no control over myself or something
it's like
idk it didn't bother me cuz meaghan couldn't remember her area code at first either
she asked for their area code
that's what i thought at first
and she hasn't accepted or anything
and he gave me her name so i sent her a friend request on fb
on purpose presumably
idk like she gave me her guy friend's number
like wtf
but i honestly don't think she cares at all
and hang out next year at splash and stuff
we can still be friends
okay well
and then i was like
and she was like realllllly torn about it but i decided to not press the matter
and then she was like idk if i should i sorta have a thing with a guy
and so we got really close
so i interpreted her snuggliness as wanting to hook up
which, by the way, is a symbol of wanting to hook up
and she was getting really cuddly
*alone
and eventually we were sorta along
*idk
like explored id
we went on a tour
she took me to see the metro station
she was like really nice
sarita
that girl
okay well
wait brb
oh hii
l8r alig8r
i'm sorry if i've offended you with my sexualness
i'm gonna go to bed jess
haha i'm stupid when i'm tired
i'd say that's pretty good
well if i'm better than most the whole male population
ahaha i'm part of the masses jess
uh why
so you should be proud of me ahaha
i don't know of any guys that have ever turned down a hookup and i've done it a few times
for a guy i'm remarkably un-superficial
ahahaha
and i guess i'm kind of a sexual person
then it wasn't meant to be anyway
if she hates me for who i am
i don't wanna limit my options because of something that MIGHT happen in the future
so i didn't really feel bad going out and meeting someone else
so i def don't wanna let her tie me down again
and it sucked
and i was like tied to her
so i couldn't go out with anyone
but wanted to be like close friends
and she like didn't wanna go out]
we almost went out a few years ago
like first off
i've been rethinking my thing with kelsey
you know honestly
oh
shut up
cute is not just a looks thing
kelsey?
she was really cute too
haha but what do i know
cuz like if she wanted to give me the wrong number she prob wouldn't have changed out a single digit
yeah but i actually think it wasn't on purpose tho
he said he'd talk to her in school the next day
so apparently everyone in Maine knows everyone in Maine
knows her apparently
but the guy who's num she gave me
haaha yeah she did
you're nice too
yay claudia's nice
how was the rest of splash
at burger king haha
that could be it
idk we stopped and ate
at like 11:10 ish
heyyy bud
yay :)
i've got soo much crap
it's like a planning nightmare though
sammeee
that's rare
is she rlly pretty?
aw
and it's not like you can't get a guy
why? it's probably not the sorta relationship you'd want
aw that's so cute haha
haha whyd he chat you
or like commonly accepted
haha by your standards?
haha sweet
oh
what?
sooo excited
<3
why are you in all caps haha?
i can't stop sneezing

one that makes a lot of money
and if you don't
i mean i'm sure you'll get a great job

yeahh haha pretty clever
well he's not going to admit it in public probably
why
depressing right
so ^^ i highly doubt it
and i can't imagine he's out of your league in attractiveness
and obviously you guys get along
B, how well they know the person/how much they like them
and
A, if they're close enough in attractiveness to consider them a bf/gf
by
a lot of people judge liking someone
i doubt it
then yeah tell him
but if you're sure
no
so if you're not sure
but i think whenever you tell someone you like them you realize you don't
normally i'd say yes
well
one
lmao im watchin the adolf hitler vs darth vader
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zn7-fVtT16k

but i can like
and people will like never believe me that i made it up on the spot
just from my head and not repeat once

haha well
<3 <3 <3 <3 <3
i think i just fell in love with you jess
i'm soooo horribly stupid when it comes to sightreading
well he's better at sightreading
haha i love you jess
because every girl i've ever met has thought he is fucking hot and he's 1000 times better at piano than i am and he's like four inches taller
you know at the same time i hate him
hehe love that kid
http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=125699007539336&set=a.113856612056909.18023.100002977120624&type=1&theater hehe look at dis pic
i wish i could saysomething really wise
bleah
are you afraid people will judge you?
asdflkh
sdlkjh
ehrmm
well
blah
really
and how did that happen?
who knows
haha maybe i'm bi
nooo it's fine'
lmao like you
and don't worry people think i'm gay too sometimes
not gonna lie i have no clue what exude means but i can probably ratiocinate it means something along the lines of "to give off"
you just don't exude a vibe that you're "not a lesbian"
you don't!!
or just 'exude' a vibe that suggests that you're not a lesbo
i don't think vaginas came up in our conversations much
actually just a penis
you never said anyone was hot and you were like ewww whenever like a vagina or a penis came up in conversation
yeah if i had then i wouldnt have assumed you were gay haha i just didn't get like a sexual vibe from you
well i think people assume because you don't feel sexually towards guys you must feel sexually towards girls
i'm not gonnna talk on this one cuz i made the same mistake
uhmm well its all going well
kelsey?
i thought it was due friday
but it turns out i have a chem lab due tomorrow
10:00

Her: Noo say it
Me: Bleh I sort of want to say something here but it'll make me look like an ass if i do
Her: What

and yeah how many girls do you know that basically beg a guy to hook up with them
i told her we're going to continue this conversation at a later period in time
and she flipped shit too
and then she told her friend
idk how you can type insults that fast
she exploded
turns out girls get realllllllly touchy on that subject
"I think you're desperate"
so i told her

so i'm fine
i don't think there are any bridges over lava
jess
jess
and i should really go to bed i was supposed to 2 hours ago
and it was a good week but the more i think about it the farther i get from getting anywhere and the closer i get to jumping off a bridge into lava
haha especially this week
btw
i do try
...
aughh its 3:00
*sigh it's the little things
lololol i got a request from fb for a group called "Petition to Shorten Lil Wayne's Jail Time." and at first all i saw was "Petition to Shorten Lil..." and a picture of Lil Wayne haha
i'm at home being a nerd
he's always got like ten people following him
every girl in the grade wants him
a majorly HOT girlfriend
1590 fb friends
and
he has probably a 2.8 or a 3.0 gpa
the thing is
and he always tells me that we look the same
i got a free ride to a party because someone thought i was him
literally
and we look the exact same
there's a kid in my grade
know what pisses me off
i don't fit in hugely
i do i guess
and i have no good friends
and i hate that
but then some people call me weird
yeah i think people see me as a person that's cool
people say hi to me in the hallway
nobody hates me
idk
and ermm
apparently soo
hehe
(:
(L
heheheh
and did not come out how i meant it
while typing something else
honestly i think i typed that
you know
it sucks to be an ass
well
if i had one good friend and a girlfriend i would be the happiest person on the planet
that's about it haha
hmm
well
hahahahaha i'm so used to :/ it's instictual
:)
that was supposed to be smiley
woops
thanks :/
see jeff was a good friend
and woooops i'm an asshole
just sometimes i say the wrong thing
it's not like a physical charactaristic
no but i mean
honestly i'm an ass sometimes
well nobody's perfect
haha honestly jess i don't really have any
haha jess i don't have many friends
and laughing with other people
and what makes me happy is having friends
because it's my life
"good question..."
"why do you care about everyone and everything?"
is just ridiculous to me
"what do you care"
but saying
that wasn't
well
that's 100% the wrong thing to say
say that
don't
nononono
do people think i'm a freak or do they like me
i always get so nervous
thinking about it makes me wanna jump off a bridge or something
maybe we shouldn't talk about this
ahh
like
"weird"
idk i hate that word
except for bitches who call you weird every now and then
idk if you act happy people are nicer
i'm alot more outgoing
but like in class
haha i still don't really talk to her
you are pretty awesome
and besides you made my whole week better
hahaha thanks jess u 2
ahh i guess i can stay up longer
but uh hey jess i should probably go to bed
but i'm still ur bud
yeah i've noticed that
aww jess the troublemaker
it is nice
yeah not gonna lie you guys are way more badass then us
abuse makes me happy in a weird way
yeah
haha
no i'm not going to sleep?
jess im gonna go to sleep
wow i'm weird
but i'm completely content just eating an apple and staring at a wall because i'm glad to exist and glad to have food and not be in pain
and get bruises and burns and get abused by my team and get humiliated
i have to lose unhealthy amounts of weight and cut back and shit and work out and lose all my weekends and run in the cold and miss my winter break
because i hate wrestling season soooo much
are during wrestling season
the happiest times of my life
believe it or not
it's the boring crap in my life that makes me happy
and programming becomes a chore
but if i don't program, then family guy just becomes normal
*family guy will always be more fun than programming
fail
wow
so family guy will always be more fun than family guy
family guy is more interesting
then i watch family guy
but if i program for a while
because in contrast they both make me happy
then yeahh i'lll be alot happier
and watch family guy in moderation
just program
if i
like
game theory
but ANYWAY
haha not to me
ah
you're smile and hair and stuff make you pretty anyway
haha gp
please don't take that the wrong way
like they don't affect your look much
yeah but your boobs have nothing do to with your looks
hahaha i don't think you should worry
i think that's impossible
okay they're def not
game theory here
ready
wait
wait
wait
hold on
well
yeah but it's easier to watch family guy
like i didn't do any programming or anything over the summer
yeah but like during the summer i don't follow any of that stuff
and i have no willpower to restrain
four of five years of that i'd kill myself probably
no work
i can do whatever i wantt
like i get soo depressed during the summer
i just know me
noo not at all
but i'd still take it haha
but i know i'd be happier without it
that's a good point
i'm glad you answered that way
what if it was 10 million
it's someone rich and they don't need it and they decide to give it away on a whim
if someone offered you a million dollars would you take it
ahahaha idk why i think it's funny
"You may have five dollars, but it's at the bottom of this jar filled with salt and barbed wire/"
"Can I borrow some money?"
ahaha on family guy
really haaha?
win anything?
do you remember what you did??
yeahhh do you do it
haha i should probably start worryin about that
idk the whole process
and arranges it so that you can slowly iterate through them
it linkes it to a new array
but instead of deallocating old arrays to replace them with new ones
it's sorta like an arraylist
do you know anything about data structures?
it's really confusing
no passion haha
i didn't really care that much last year
nah i didn't
choicee
nah it's finee
guess that settles that...
oh
Post WWI
but when i think of like modern i think of like
and turned into this bloody froth
and like his whole head got sucked into the helmet
and then they depressurized his suit
they made like a deep sea diver out of a skeleton and like meat
the most gruesome thing on mythbusters
i just saw
omg
200 years old haha
hmm not what i think of
is that modern art?
yeah i was thinking about that
creepy
like
i'm not gonna lie i didn't think that deep into it it's just scary
it's bad that it's really only art that disturbs me that interests me
i have no clue
http://madamepickwickartblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/magritte2.jpg
h/o
hold on there's like one piece of art that really interests me
hmm yeah i'm sorry i don't know that much about visual art
haha thank god gummy bears don't every try to kill us
yeahh haha
he like incinerated it
my chem teacher killed a gummy bear today
haha yeah gp
yeah but when i meet my exchange student how do i pronounce it haha
ahh that's confusing
it's a name
syou
someone said
long "o"
jo
like
someone said
everyone keeps telling me differently
really?
in chinese
Zhu
hey how do you pronounce
i'm sorry i know i'm really boring
this is one of those things that'lll send me into depression
can we change the subject?
yeahh
yeah i know
yeah i think you're right
while the shier, or less attractive guys usually have a funny picture or a picture with friends as their profile pic
their proud of their cool lives and how cool they look
the buff guys will always have their shirt off on the beach with a surfboard
or family
the less pretty ones usually have pictures with a bunch of a friends
but it's only the pretty ones that do that
cuz girls are so vain and such
like trying to make themselves look as hot as possible
like you always see girlss in their profile pics
have you ever noticed people put what their proud of in their profile pictures
people can be stupid
jess i'm sorry
did you ever talk to them
and i have the same problem with my best friend at my school
jess just most people at this stage in their life don't think enough
oh don't say that
aw what are you talking about?
haha aww
i guess your parents dont wake you up?
that seems impossible haha
are you sure that's healthy?
jess that's not good...
why not?
whats new with you
haha you've got it figured out jess
so thankss jessica
which is probably 75% your doing haha
hmmm i had a pretty good week (:
yeah ikr?
it's like a cross between an arraylist and a binary AVL like tree
it's a data structure that iterates through like an expanding list of arrays
my projects gonna be so cool
i'm so excited for science fair
haha same
whatsupp
jessibearr
jesssss!!
aww like someone
we're sorta hics
yeah haha
yeah that undoubtable
:(
mehhhh my mom says people in your region are hicss
im backkk
heyy brb
its part of it
haha someone else whos having a chinese student invited us to a party at the exact same place
guess what
duuude
byeee
okay no but seriously i really should shower
i'm sure you've got a lot of oomph bundled up
don't tackle me though
aww i'm your friend!!!
hey ima go take a shower
YOU ARE MINE!!!!
like oh hey ther...BAM
just tackle a guyy
be confident
haha maybe take some of your own advice
haha locker girlll
just kinda lonely
so it's not like i hated my life
well people stopped bullying me
yeahh i need something like that
buttt you got out of it
so i had nobody to go to
like my only, and best friend left too to make it worse
like a lemony snicket book or something...
that one goddamnnn year
haha it could be 7th grade...
yeahh
thanks jess (:
yeah i guess :/
not saying i am
how many people do you know that are really ugly and really confident?
how many people do you know that are realllly hot and realllly shy
but i don't have an issue with keeping friends its meeting new friends and interacting with people
granted, your a nice person and thats why people STAY friends with you
because if you were a bumbling idiot people would still like you
and you're hot so its realllllly easy to say just be confident and people will like you
is 99% about looks
peoples initial reaction to people
and its easy for you jess to be confident because honestly
i'll try being confident
screw that!!
like NO!
just touch it
comeeee onnn
and then someone says
you stop touching the stove
time you get burned
or fifth
or third
or second
after the first
it's like touching a stove
and i nevvvver did anything wrong i was just nice and had confidence and it turned out to my the worst year of my life
well when your in a locker room in front of 5 guys yelling shit about you it's pretty fucking hard
being confident got me a hot girlfriend its just people bullied me about it!!
no i wasn't!
at all
and it got me nowhere
its just i WAS confident once
yeah i guess
"freak"
god i hate that
yeahh but you're so social now
"social anxiety"
and jess you said yourself you've got it too
i'm such an idiot
sorry
gah fuck life
who wants to perform and get food thrown at them
only if you think people are going to react well
and be social
so!? you should want to perform
again, 7th grade
*theatre
and i got teased for doing theare
and i performed horribly
s u c k e d
it
my friend convinced me to do a play with him
summer after 7th grade
again,
"You sounded horrible"
my best friend
"You sounded horrible"
kids after reception
voice teacher: you sound amazing!!
mom:you'll sound so good!
sounded like a reallllly cool idea 9 weeks in advance
i tried out for a chorus solo
7th grade
first one
a few actually
well two things
and i know exactly why too
and i think i do have it
blah
like what am i supposed to do!!
there are so many other hosting families if its really that good of an idea someone else will organize a party or something!
like wtf!!
but i'm not like a sociaphobic
!!
i'm a little shy sometimes
i don't hate people!!!
like COMEON
and there is a really, really, really, really hot girl hosting one of the chinese students and i don't wanna be the gay kid who hosts a f***ing hayride in the middle of hic country
it's a stupid idea!!
we're either taking all the chinese kids on a hayride and getting icecream at merrymeade or you're planning something unique to do with him every night and we're taking you to a psychiatrist
and shes saying to me
goddamnit were hosting a chinese student
jesss my parents think i have social anxiety :(
heyyy jess
byebyee
sorry i have an early SAT class
have a good night jessbear
ima go to bed
hmmm
but you find out its because he's got an inferiority complex
but mean to everyone else irrationally
well what if someones nice to you
and what if they're nice to you but you figure out they're just trying to have sex with you
what if they're mean to a friend but nice to you?
you can't just label people nice or mean
i'm sure there are people you don't like
that's not true
what do you mean
*theatre people
who try to be weird
all the smart people are all like belfry people
that's smart and ordinary
idk theres no social clique
blah life is depressing
jesss i don't fit in at my school
yeahhh haha but they'd secretly think i'm like messed up in the head
she'd be like WTFSRONGWITHYOU
hahaha see if i said that to a girl
(they can't digest humans so he's okay :) )
he'll find his way out soon i'm sure
nahh he probably got swallowed by a maneating plant
and if i dont keep it in check it springs out of hand
i think i have a superiority complex
ahh okay
idk i feel like whenever im confident i get cocky
thanks :) i need confidence
haha she's too pretty for me
not really haha
her lockers next to mine and we chat after school sometimes
yeahh she is
haha look her up
like most cute girls
*skank
i know you think its superficial but she's really pretty and she's like not a bitch or a skand
haha her names ali simkins
there's a girl at my school i'm interested in
aww
he might ask you out
although
fine then yeah ask him if he likes you
okay ask him if he thinks your attractive
ask him if he thinks your pretty
a little
haha i bet i'm right
then im jealous of the guy
if you think this guys hot
cuz hes saying
hes coming on to you
not really needed though
haha yeah
he meant of him
literally that means hes gay then i think its not how he meant it
well
oooo whatd you say
i like it when i'm alluded too
nice in a self centered way
that's kind of
wow
hahaha
how did you describe me
what????
and idk you don't make annnny sense to me whatsoever when it comes to who you like
damn i want one
do you have an ap compsci textbook?
also
but it's not bad that you arent
the answer would be yes
i think for most people
well
you're kind of unconventionally programmed
not necessarily
is it this thomas boy
cuz then you sound like you don't care
nahh
i actually just laughed out loud
hehe
ahahah yeah that's where i was going
do you enjoy sneezing?
jess

specifically
/piano teacher
i'm entering the process that will spit me out a music teacher...
i've been better but i just had a really boring day
i'm good!!
oooh if you want me to leave you alone i can
how are youu
heyyy
a qubit can be <0 but >1
i don't think it's safe to make analogies to every aspect of life
well yeah and a bit can either be a 1 or a 0
how can you possibly identify something as either good or bad?
you're just as bad as the bully
and you just watch
if the bully is beating someone up to impress you
likewise
you're 1/10 as bad as the bully
watching someone get beaten up
so if you're in a crowd of ten people
since they had absolutely no idea it was going on
but the first number is zero
theoretically no WWII
if they hadn't had hitler
take hitlers parents
so for instance
the amount of power you have to change it or the amount of knowledge that you have of it going on TIMES the severity of it
you are for something is simple
"responsible"
how
the way i see it
bad
i don't think it's as
well do you think there's a grey area?
why?
how?
aw what's wrong :(
how are youuu
heyy i miss thee too
well okay byee jessy :)
ah
okayy!!

i didn't know that about you :(
hence the different part
ahh jess were so alike but so different
yeah that doesn't happen to me

"As we paraplegics say 'When life takes your legs away, make leganade'"
this paraplegic is like

do you know Kevin Mitnick?
yepp you're a good friend
okay thanks :) you help alot
or something
i need sleep
blahh
like what
ah the world is stupid
i just
no you are
not really
who get happy
they're attracted to attractive ones
people aren't attracted to happy people
not really :?
meh
and it's a horrible world :/
people are never ever in the entirety of human existance judge people on anything but looks
and i realize that nobody really cares about me that much
but then it changes nothing
i always get confident in myself
asdlk
like auughh i'm so lonely i need someone i just feel like i'm going to be lonely forever
idk i think i have no confidence
i've honestly been better
meh
how are youu
hey jess
my mom says she's thinking of taking me out to tour harvard right before
okayy
phew
okay
crap i didn't sign up for splash
what about you?
better than last year haha
good i guess
and i'm sure you are too
thanks :/
maybe
meh
i'm always afraid that like i'm way behind everyone else that's trying to get into schools like MIT or CalTec
at 15
but like
i'm sort of having like a middle aged crisis
hmm
oh if you don't want me to distract you i won't
whatsupp?
heya jess
so goodnight and sweet dreamss
before i go
heyy jess i was about to go to bed but then i saw you were on so i figured i'd say goodnight (:
xD
okay cya niece/anam cara/jessbear
hahahah yes you're my niece
me neither i don't think
can you do that?
sure haha
i thought i was your soul friendd
):
aww i feel bad now
hey i gotta go
gahh they just creep me out
idk i'd rather hug a snake then touch a tick
my biggest irrational fear is ticks
yeah
it was so scary
and all i felt was like pure horror
that looked like a bunch of grapes
and there was this giant buggg
and like i looked under it or reached under it
i was sitting in a chair i think?
was like
one of my most terrifying dreams as a kid
when i was younger they were bad
not anymore as much
and i have some pretty disturbing dreams
most 15 year old boys
*unusual
which is unusualy
not like sex
i think most of my dreams have to do with finding love and such
but uhmm
i only remember the disturbing ones
hmm
i think that's not too uncommon
it's kinda like you're falling down but you know there's a bunch of pillows to catch you
i sort of like the feeling
but kinda like when you fight off sleep for a few hours and then finally you resign and let sleep smother you
from our perspective it's kinda meloncholy
i guess that is kinda happy
like inevitably
hahaha didn't we kinda die though?
aww really?
yeah you told me about that
only we were locked in?
didn't you say you had a dream with me in it that was sorta like it?
*disturbing
yeah that's really kinda distrubing
wow
like what?
really?
tell me about somee
really??
what about you?
and one time i woke up thinking i wouldn't be able to move because i didn't have a character controller script
i remember waking up once thinking that my dog was an inefficient data storage type
it would be about programming
when i used to program all the time
it would always be about videogames
when i used to play videogames 24/7
hmm it depends what my life is like
and i wish i could lucid dream
i wish i could remember more
well
you pick
hmmm

she just never seems enthusiastic about it
i mean she doesn't say that
which kind of bothers me
but is okay with the idea of like hooking up and stuff
idk it's like she shies away from the idea of like hanging out
like lots of sexual jokes, double entendres
but it's like a flirtatious relationship
good friends
well
but i sort of get the impression she only wants to have a physical relationship with me haha
and we're both all lovey dovey for each other
and i love videogames and i really like this girl

i think i do actually
yo dude are you leaving?
goddamnit
eh
yo was history hard
np bro
id think that yeah its just its inability to deal with foreign bullshit
i havent worked on preparing for it yet
idk thats my initial thoughts
I suppose
their ''satellite'' states are getting taken (ie vietnam and korea)
the British are forcing trade on them
Japan's taking its land
Britain's taking its ports
its getting picked apart piece by piece by foreign powers
i guess the main reason is that its weak
hmm
anger at foreign powers
derived from japans defeat over Russia
instilled nationalism
idk some reasons are
specifically the fall if the qing dynasty?
isnt it like why the empire collapsed
im in kimmel
nah mines tuesday
thanks lol
seems younger LOL?
why aha?
like september
i think beginning of the year?

In spending a lifetime suffering the perfidy of newly-trusted adults, Zit fails to ascertain the necessary confidence to connect with others.

i know for a fact
to take a different route
and you literally curved
i walked towards you
today

Natalie

he's a pretty understanding guy
oo okay <3
oh haha are you doing it tonight?
ours is due tomorrow
haha really?
he said when you introduce a quote, always do it situationally rather than like by the page number
in the actual passage
he hates it when people include the page number
he told us today in class
one thing though
i like it
yeah i know what you mean
is it too verbose haha?
but no i stopped doing that because it made my writing sound horrible
i'll look it up
that i think sounds right
a word in the back of my head
sometimes if i have like
it's one scene though :/
...ok...
:(
The scene in which Frank interacts with the elderly Mr. Timoney profoundly alters Frank’s perception of life; Frank begins to respect foreign cultures, recognize his own literary talents, and find consolation in a kindred spirit.
i said
wait
fuck it is
is that unclear haha?
yesss
like The Odyssey
it's a "coming of age story"
it's a word Mrs. Burnett always used
i don't want to ruin your sleep haha
just skim it haha
okay
btw

alright
snuggles did it work?
did it work?
?
?
did you try it
Ca2
its like
and if you get 2 for Calcium
and you'll get numbers like
then divide them all by the LOWEST number of moles there are
then youre going to have a certain amount of MOLES of each
no
then convert them all to molar masses
etc
then youre going to have 38.77 grams of calcium
imagine you have a 100 gram sample
there are going to be how many grams of each substance?
100 grams
lets assume you have a sample of this substance
alrightey
?
i assume
and all these percentages are by weight?
okay
like what info does it give and what does it want back
what are the questions kinda like?
so you know the difference between a molecular and empirical formula?
or how to solve for them..? or what
do you want to explain the difference between them
alrightey
alright lemme check something
yeahh
wait you still there
yeah
who you calling bitch?
alright
don't be a...
it was funny!!!!
my dog just ate a stinkbug
hehe
?
haha cinderella
^ lmfao do you get it
he said "Oh damn it's midnight already?"
and when he got caught
*pumpkin
who got caught fucking a pumpking
haha i heard this story about a guy
haha hyperbole inception :)
like it's a paradox haha
like the quote just made sense
hehe
woahhh i just got that
“New York City, city of exaggerations. Place of Herculean ascensions and perilous falls.”
and it messes with your sex life afterwards
hahaa you know the smaller you are supposedly the more painful it is
hushhh

@(k-k)@ #

i mean they're good
nope
:(
playing while a bunch of people sing
theres a dude on guitar
i did too
theyre fantastic
uh
alright
ik i'm a horrible person
<3
haha even if i loved a girl with all my heart i don't think i could do that
if you're playing xbox you can be talking tooo and having all around fun but sitting in front of a stage is boring as fk
it's not like you can talk or anything
but like seeee if you're watching that piece of crap
maybee
ahhhh
ehrmmmm
uh
like see as a guy, i can give up some stuff. Like I'd let a girl paint my nails if she'd play with me
but it's true love if a girl plays just to make me happy haha <3
and just invites me
but like she plays cuz she wants to play
you know when kelsey plays it isnt actually that great though
and COD Zombies would trump both, but that's just unrealistic
honestly Halo or COD
nah any of them are good
give me an awesome deep neck massage
come to one of my wrestling matches
watch horribly scary movie with me (but not as a clingy thing)
play cod with me
things that you could do to be my best friend
just as a fun exercise

i am so fucking terrified but exhilerated at the same time
and they couldn't follow me

and then i jumped into a moat and swam to this little island
and they tried to get me too
and then these people came that were like doing construction work on the forest
and they were like everywhere
and i was like running through the woods
and then they started chasing me!!!

dude the other males in my family are so filled with hatred

kelsey stopped texting me

i have every reason to be happy right now but i'm really depressed

^minus sign
-alicia
ooo that does sound fun
what is itt
?

cuz of nicki/emily?
any particular reason
haha yay :)
yeah she's a funny one
"He's going to ask me to Semi, and then he's going to bring me to PROM and then we are going to FUCK!!"
Emily said
meanwhile
"Oh well she seems really nice but I just want to know her a little more well before I do anything decisive"
Nick was like
when i first tried to set them up
si
haha "Oh look natalie im'ed me...oh wait :("
haha its chill
stay happy
okayyy :) bye
can't promise ill be quick on the reply
^changed my life
"Confidence is free"
know what saying would do you a lot of good
let's not be pessimistic
don't put yourself below him before you even get into a relationship
don't think so deeply into it haha
trust mee girlie
i'm pretty sure you two will
you should like the person you're going to go out with
that's a good reason
he doesn't think very highly of liz
i talked to him last night don't worry you're on the right path
explainn
so sorry if i seem strange haha
that sorta put me in a weird mood for the rest of the day
"My life's 2/3 gone... son of a bitch where did it go?"
he was like
my dad said the saddest thing i've ever heard in my life today
and their all gonna be like nah im good
im going to want to hang out with all these people
see when winter break starts
my bro, helen, you, jason
it makes me feel popular but i realized everyones just massively bored
i've put off hanging out with so many people today
haha i'm doing hw i can't sorry
it bothers me
jk but seriously
i think we should kill her -.-
she didn't even like need help
im not even in her class and she's better at chemistry!
there's a movie like this it's called Obsessed
yeah which is why she's debateably sick in the head
i think she gets a kick out of me wanting to like be her friend
and she has a bf too
which is why it annoys me
yes i do like kelsey!
so when suddenly someone doesn't like her... uh oh!
she always has to have everyone's affection
like i think she goes out of her way to like capture me
she definitely wants to piss me off
and she calls me
she could have asked helen g, matt, dan, dani, chris, reena, natalie dowz, austin, Helen b, max, matt, kevin, even arjun
she knows i don't like her
i suck at chemistry
theres 1000000000 other people to ask
see why would she do that
Alicia just called me for a chem question and im not even in her chem class
?
>
yeah suree
gross?
nattttt
it doesn't really matter that much
haha well w/e
yeahh but you have that thing kelsey doesn't have haha
yes
do i look 12??
lmao
lmao my soudy friend says she looks like a 12 year old
nat in your honest opinion does kelsey look 12 haha?
byeeee
i'm vidchatting with kelsey later i think
ill be on for a while
ttyl
nvm
continue
i'm going to take a shower
it pisses me the fuck off
blah
right
we didn't even have this conversation -.-
don't tell alicia any of this
?
so you can purposefully make me feel like shit
oh really? cuz you got a full grade better than me?
"oh i did so horribly on that test"
100% of the time
she has to make everyone feel like shit
it's not just me
to people
like why does Alicia do that
i'm sorry
:/
i guess i probably deserve it
i'm sorry
:/
but she's probably the closest thing there is
i don't hate anyone
and now shes going out with that other faggot
or even bringing it up
i don't ever remember her apologizing to me
when the fuck was this?
the old "alicia playing dumb" routine
and she pretends like nothing ever happened
i don't get it
too cool for me
yeah she just stopped talking to me
cuz shes responsibile or some shit like that
"Oh yeah I just decided to cut it off with him"
so the whooooooole time we had something she was really just waiting until she could get with the other guy
so she could get this other motherfucker
to break it off with me
and she was just waiting until the last second
she had promised that she would fuck with the whole time we had something
as it turned out
who
yeah she cut it off cuz she found some other kid to fuck with
that's one way of putting it
haha
did she say why she cut it off
is that how she described it haha
what do you think happened
what do you think happened
no you don't haha
i don't need another one of my friends thinking im an asshole haha
let'sss not talk about it i already vented on Helen
haha
just ignore her
...
and alicia
eh liz isnt a bad person shes just a little boy crazy
yeah she would say that
i heard alicia was being really obnoxious haha
btw how was your birthday partty
hahaha lemme think
ill get you one too!
ahahaha you can get me one
harry potter thing?
hahaaha
lmao
hahahah explainnn
not that i hate alicia
don't worry i don't hate you
i was saying one thing to helen and another to you and i got mixed up
lol woops
hey licia
awww haha :(
why are you in the car with them haha
ooo who
haha nm you?
hey nattles
okay nitesies
yeah ik
fuck my life
blah lift tomorrow morning
byeee
i gtg
nvm im being nosy
haha phone?
so it wasnt on fb?
haha fb?
??
when did he tell you
nice amiga
he told ya?
liking you?
lmfao
that's a pun haha
"It's so appealing"
that line
it just occurred to me
i love that songgg
hehe
i remember i was with nelson and he wanted to come talk to you and i was like noooo
haha
nope
oh okay the banana jogged my memory
like on your phone
you called me?
hermmm
when?
no
what haha?
haha
hah
actually that's a total lie it is
yeahhh see moving on isn't that hard
haha didn't have to
but i'd say were coming ot of it
yeah haha i wish a certain someone else would do that to me
?
ahaha did you mean about us taking a break?
about the math thing?
(hehe)
about what?
i usually am
mm gotcha
haha what?
tanks haha
i helped your cousin with that like two years ago and she got an A on the quiz the next day it like made my year
np
you sstill add it
thats 0
yeah
did you say a negative minus a negative?
oh wait
5-(-5) = 10
the same as adding it
sure go ahead
hmm that is cool
yeah and i probably know more about his love life than anyone else you've talked to
yeahh
but its still my best friend she fucked with
and legit it will ruin her reputation for the rest of highschool
dude honestly i feel horribly for Evelyn cuz of the position shes in
not gonna say she doesn't deserve it
so evelyn is probably not going to semi
Max said he was gonna text her and tell her to go with chris
even if it were Leigh
then change my mind
i'm not going to say yes to someone
what?
id say no to kelsey
and kelsey asked me
if i did say yes
probably
i'd say no
i suggested that he should
its partially my fault
i hate girls
:(
bleh
belh
that pisses me off so much
but he didn't just say screw you
remember Zeke asked Ashley last year and by the time Semi rolled around he was going out with Natalie Dowzicky
and it doesn't fucking matter
the reason Mr. Gearhart got pissed at us in Singing Patriots cuz he wouldn't shut the fuck up about it cuz he was like ecstatic
yeah
what the fuck
yeah
omfg
the thing with chris
dude
yo nat
and im sorry that sounds boring
ah i gtg love :(
haha
aww :(
blah
he talks about youu
f'real
i think he does
haha
stop
dude
don't do it
if you consider alicia as your friend and you trust her you will end up with a broken heart, possibly crying
see
do you know that
i don't wanna talk smack on her behind her back
don't listen to alicia
don't even get me started on that girl
por que?
yeahh see
i know but normally im very expressative
like im really really really happy im just not good at showing it
*as shit

idk
computerr
haha losing in chess....
whatsup
ohh hi
my friend on FB is pissing me off
hey i'm gonna switch to AIM
maybe though
i doubt there's a direct correlation though
maybe
not a qwerty keyboard sorry
yeah but you're not on a qwerty
yeah that would explain much...
and in the middle start banging down with their right hand
cuz they start with the very left of the keyboard and slowly move to the right
asdflkj
and when most people bang on their keyboard it starts with
haha
but i wonder what it says about us as individuals
there are people out there that can use that to destroy in rock paper scissors contests
some people always do the same move on a tie
because they figure the other person won't repeat
some people will always repeat the move they just played AFTER losing
for instance
rock, paper, scissors
every human has his own algorithm for when to play which move
are incabable of being random
all humans
because
if you play more than once with someone
you know that it's possible to almost always win in rock paper scissors shoot?
i think there's something to be said for people's self percieved illusions of randomness
interesting
hmm
i'm waiting
....
DO IT
bang on your keyboard

lol
uhm volume control

yeah haha
-.-
okay then
but, ik i'll probably regret this but the song is called Bat Country
i gtg in 6 min
= \
sorry i get spacey sometimes
yeah
you know if you run into a wall 10^100000 times you'll eventually go through
and the quantum mechanics kicks in with sort of a global randomness
thats the squished version
but its objective: It doesn't have an opinion
well i believe fate, in a sense exists
haha okay
i'd rather you keep it going for once -.-
lol no see i know exactly how to keep a conversation going
all bring a conversation from big to small
"No I'm good I'd rather not listen. I don't wanna hear it. Ok. Lol. Nm"
that attitude of
im saying
no
say*
there are plenty of things that you could sa
see this is where the death of conversation comes from
lol omg
...
haha okay then
haha i can smush it into like two sentences if you'd like
thats a question thats impossible to link a yes or a no with
?
so idk if you wanna hear it
and it involves quantum mechanics
its a lil complicated haha
idk if you wanna hear my answer
thats a very complicated question
yeah sure
yeah its not terribe
haha it sounds like a a good copywrite infrigement oppurtunity
no i mean
lol
im 90% sure theres a song this is copied off
lol okay
what song lol
i'm 99% sure you'd misinterpret it
haha id rather not tell you
idk why
theres a song by them where a part of it reminds me of you
no it is haha
yeah haha

around girls i hate him

lol
omg im not
thats cuz she knows all the grade
liz pisses me off
haha
no?
LOL
haha your still friends with Tyler Thurlow
uhm
and i the reason i like franco is because he and davonne are the only two kids in the grade who share an interest of computers with me and i look up to his pencil spinning capabilities. i disagree with his blatant racism
lol
aw
i would however lose a large amount of respect
obviously i would not cease our friendship because of one of your friends
and im slightly overexaggerating
actually as long as you never mention him as your friend im fine
a nasty attitude
Tyler's like a whale with a bad attitude
francos witty and cute
you don't realize
and im gonna go kill myself he has more fb friends than me
no shes not haha

yeah
erhm
hey alicia!!
Actually nvm I'm good
Yo wanna take me to Neemas?
haha same yo. aight i gotta do english good luck
i'ma do that in a free before
aight sounds good, i didn't actually study it i just made it
aight np just don't promote it
? bio or history?
good fucking bye
like
but actually ciao
haha my humor does not really translate over fb
*dick
suck mah pussy
fuck you man haha
like it's gotten to the point where i can be relatively confident in the opposite of what you say
also i do not trust you in the slightest
i never heard that
yeaaaaaaah that's only your class
where does it say that
yeaaaaaah not in your class whore
aight peace fag i got an outline to make
-.-
but i don't think you'll know about them
yes
good point i definitely would not trust you with a pet
like 8
i have this strange premonition that you're going to have a lot of cats when you grow up
and gay
you are 100% a huge fucking distraction
i know, sister, i know
i trusted in your intelligence
suck on them apples
well maybe it wasn't consensual
you dirty whore
i heard some dude say that about you ;)
only she broke up with him by telling him she was a lesbian haha
that happened to my bro though
hahaha poor lukey
hahah does Luke know?
there we go
ahhh
wtf what's her name
really???!?!
yeah i forget her name though
uh oh
let me think about that
yeah that would be pretty cool actually
also, i think "best of" videos do well
that actually is kind of a good idea haha
so when you look up "shaytards" it comes out
and it's about them
shaytards are like one of the top youtube channels
*man
peace pan
i have homework
let that rumble around in your head
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9k2CCjoLvo
200 bucks off of this video
kelsey remig made like
hold on
alright ready
that happens
haha we would get kicked from youtube :/
...is it out yet
like "Shaytards" "PewdiePie" "JennaMarbles"
or any of those top youtube users
in the title
"Ray William Johnson"
anything that pretty much has
but then you actually have to make a semi interesting looking video
you can monetize on that
and while you can't monetize on the lyric video itself
so people see it
the topmost one you can choose
featured videos are just the videos that pop up on the right hand side of the page
noo
so that's like 300 dollars
if there's a really interesting looking "featured video" maybe a third would click on it
and let's say it gets 1 million views,
so have a lyric video
would be to actually promote another video from the first
the best way it seems to me
honestly
and the ones that do find ways to get around it
most of them don't monetize honestly,
the biggest issue is copyright violatioins
well
eh kinda too late
Gangnam Style?
hmm is it out already?
if you wait too long, a video will get so many views that it pushes all the other videos with a similar name down
a lot of times
yeah but the one problem that has is that
but have a link in the video to another video, which is monetized
is to put up lyric videos that aren't monetized
slightly less effective
another good way we could actually get around it
or teasers
sometimes they put like demos up
usually they announce it early
yeah she is
whatev
Lady Gaga, Pitbull, Eminem
the best stuff is gonna singles from popstars like
look for some new and upcoming albums/singles to be released
i need to look up into the actual process of it more first
haha yeah man it's a pretty sweet idea
but that can be hit or miss :/
that makes it undetectable by like their programs
that slightly alters the pitch
or you can use a program (Audacity works, and it's free)
since evidently they only check the first thirty seconds
so you can either put up thirty seconds of "no sound"
haha i know right
the first is to put like
so there's kind of two ways you can tackle that issue
youtube actually has like a program that looks for songs
with a lyric video - it'll get taken down
if you just post the song
the way it works is
alright so i looked up the policy on doing it
for the Driver's Test
what's the name of that place that'll schedule you?
they're super weird but cool
and ill show you the converses on monday
aight i might get the second watch

Haha camel ride came first, but nah he actually was just going for my peanuts
Which is cooler, seeing the Brandenburg Tor or getting robbed by a monkey and riding a camel in the same day?
Nah dude, India is super fucking awesome
It's like comparing apples and peacocks though, so no comparison
It's a cool place. I'd recommend it, but I honestly like India a bit more
It's also fashion week here, so that's cool
Idk what there is in the way of watches here, but Berlin has an insane fashion sense, so I might be able to bring something back for you
Haven't decided yet
Which I'm going to next week I think
I might be able to bring back a Berliner Pilsner or a Körsch from Cologne
Idk what laws on alcohol in luggage are
Haha want me to bring anything back from Europe for you?
Oh yeah def haha
I drank at a Biergarten with some dudes from Norway doing it
So a lot of foreigners in groups of 2 or 3 are in these bars, so you meet a lot
Where they hit like 10 or 12 countries by railroad
Hahaha noooo I like it. People in Europe do things called interrail
It takes a while to get good at haha
Haha I've also learned the art of going to bars alone
As part of some coal usage protest
Haha fun fact, I formed a human chain around a building she was in
Everything is pushed back by like four hours
Duuuude haha don't, by the way Germany is cool

I'm staying with a pole dancing instructor haha
Yep, it's gonna be pretty cool
Super oriental, haha. I'm leaving India in like four days
Damn, how often do you work?
Matt's dad, right?
Yum. How's your internship thing?
I would totally skin a Bonaire Iguana with my bare hands
Haha it's def real leather, I think the retail price is like $150
Plus I try to not buy new leather products. I know that's weird haha
Nah dude literally do not, I'm not even sure if it'll look good on me
Also I don't suppose you'll be in Berlin or Puerto Rico this summer?
Hahaha no definitely not, you've lost enough money on me already, you mad scientist

like basketball-ish
originally i wanted something that would make me look kinda taller

originally that's exactly what i was looking for
woah those are pretty nice

i don't care if i can run in them
way more for comfort
i was thinking something high-top ish but i'm not really sure anymore
something nice looking, comfortable, easy to get in and out of, and pretty durable
so more like 60-120

price range maybe 100-120 range

welll
hahah no ur not
nice haha xD
temperature haha
cool how was your shower haha
k haja
haha
yess
boring haha
hows your life?
yo beth
yeah it is
Zombieville USA was made with Unity i think actually
unity3d.com is the website
then all you need for the rest is just a giant index to look up what words you need
and if you learn all the words and the grammar
with like 10 words in it
it's basically just a language
yeah if you find a good tutorial or something
eh you can pick it up in like an hour
sort of
haha it's what makes the internet run
eh it's pretty tricky you have to learn Javascript
we used Gamemaker but I develop all my games with Unity3D
what the fuck is wrong with you
do we have any singing patriots stuff friday after school
thanks man
not first
not yet
category award
np
yeah
yep
and hit delete
right click
go to C:/Windows/system32
open up my computer
though
yeah i wouldn't worry
mostly harmless
which will slow down your computer until you restart it
you'll probably just get a lot of memory leaks
but as a learning programmer
and anything a human can do with just a mouse and keyboard, a program can do
and programs can do things 1000000 faster than a human
a human could ruin a computer completely in about 3 seconds
just using the mouse
on a PC
pretty much all computer games
Google's engines
Internet Explorer
Word, Powerpoint, Excel
pretty much all the programs that people normally use are on C++
only works on PC's for the most part though
but that second half's C++
completely unrelated
nope thats JavaScript
that could potentially screw up your computer
if you want to write really fast applications
but Java's a bit slower
then learn Java
and you want it to work on a Mac and a PC
and you want to write it as fast and as easily as possible
if you want to write a program that's a normal application
you mean C++
there's C, C++, and C#
I'm guessing you mean C++?
yep i'd say so
and right now i'm testing them all

and now I'm building a little page where Kickstarter backers who "sponsored" a child in India can log in to see their kid's progress
I was mainly building a calender page where admins can schedule vaccination clinics
So they have a dashboard where you can see all the patients in their system, check their vaccination status, and do a whole bunch of other stuff
I was building a web interface for Khushi Baby's database of patients
Cuz apparently kids throw rocks at the dogs
Yeah I did that with wild dogs
oh ok
Woodstock?
Yep, haha
getting attacked by monkeys in Jaipur was super awesome
Jaipur was awesome, seeing the Taj was super cool
I got back a while ago, I think I told you most of the good stuff
India was amazing :D
Hey dude!
Hey are we froyolo-ing again?
Okay! Have fun! Also tell me what stuff you're doing this summer when you get a chance
Oh wow really? Have you spent much time in Rajasthan before?
Pani Puri is just pure happiness, I agree. You're from the south right?
Nope! And I've been eating street food, Pani Puri, eating fruit from stalls... Knock on wood but I've been fine so far
Also Udaipur is pretty dreamy
India is amazing :D :D I absolutely love it
Hey how did dualbooting go?
It makes it a bit trickier but all comps have it now
Also it's almost 1 AM here so I'm going to bed gnite!
Oo okay. That has secureboot I think, so let me know how it goes.
The little Dell?
No worries. Are you using the same computer?
David?
Weird accent, Polish maybe?
the guy from 223 we're friends with
Nah, but what's-his-name has
Hey the PowerPoint that was sent to us, will I stop at the JS part or will I be doing everything?
I can handle that, sounds good haha
Haha what if I commit though and I see the curriculum and there's something I don't know? Know what I mean? Haha
I was planning on teaching an HTML / CSS class this summer anyway
Hmm I'm totally down, I'm not sure if I'm good enough though? It'd help if I saw the curriculum
Oh, cool. Is there an email for it or something? Just something I could look at
Where is it? Could you send me anything on it?
What time is it?
Yep both fairly well
I'm not that good :/ most of my JS experience is with game programming and there's very little carryover to web
I'm okay with it, por que?
Mike
Dad 610 513 0053
2218 Hill Rd Perkiomenville PA 18074
How's 8:00
probably really early, my dad's skiing now and gets no reception, I'll ask when he's home

yeah it seems like they're def interchangeable
why are you taking Math 222 over 225?
I'm also debating doing a writing class on Science Fiction

you needed to take micro first, for that right

then maaaaybe Math 222
Eeng 201
German L2
Cpsc 223

Hey which classes are you taking this semester?
Ooo ok
It's kinda whenever
Early Sunday, haven't decided a time yet
damn okay
oh okay sweet
oh are the public ones she lists in the actual .rkt document?
what do you mean by public vs private?
whatcha mean?
public?
okay great thanks
yep! wait is there an early submission thing for Compsci?
good luck
alright dude my essay calls haha
makes sense
yeah that's weird
damnit
Oh really
is it wiring everything together?
whats prob 11?
alright sweet

alright solid thanks
oh okay. I know we were allowed to use one but I didn't know both
for assemble i think
ahh also I used string->symbol and symbol->string
although english now
loadi and stori atm
also I'm almost done with the commands!
yeah so she'd definitely clarify if they were in different number systems
she said "outputs a number" and in the example is base 10
and for output
and I assumed she'd specify if it werent
"inputs a number" from the user
the sheet she gave us said
yep!*
yep?
base 10
like
nope just numbers
ja?
actually now that I look at it, I never took AP Bio so it's useless to me anyway. fantastic!
Yeah that could work, also have you been able to figure out how to take the bio exam? It still won't list for me
Are you having your parents bring stuff separately?
And she says she'll take us up on the 18th by car
By the way, I commend you for having the patience to deal with my logistical cluelessness 😎 tis truly amazing
Oh hey I actually just cleared it up this morning , 1 sec
She hasn't even decided if she wants to drive me yet. Can I get back to you later today haha? Moms can be something
I don't pretend to understand the ways of the mothers

Hey that actually sounds like a pretty good idea, but my mom is having a my-baby-is-leaving-me freakout and wants to drive me directly there haha. She said she could take you as well?

Crap I gotta run, seeing the Jewish memorial and trying to catch a nap in Alexanderplatz today
??
Will do my man. How's your internship
󾮟🏾
:(
Oo I'm in Puerto Rico then haha with the fam
Presidential range seems dope
I kinda wanna do some New Hampshire stuff before the end of the summer
Hmm they do sound cool admittedly, I'd have to think about it more
Absolutely haha 󾮟🏼󾮟🏼 I'm trying to do a bit of hiking when I'm back, so if you're around there's that
It was wonderful while it lasted 󾇌
Ja ja, no more India :(
Let's do something Bae, noo I'm in Berlin now
I leave sixteenth, get back a little later
5 seconds after I took this pic I saw him steal some family's dinner. Fast little bastard
That's a onehanded monkey

The monkeys steal so much shit here they sometimes cut off their hands
Not even kidding I got mugged by one
Dude I saw your baboon post in the group, bro monkeys are so scary
http://www.businessinsider.com/what-ai-inceptionism-dreams-look-like-2015-6
Read this
Do you remember when I told you about neural networks?
Oh, I have something you have to read
incense peppermints
good luck my friend. enjoy the rainbow
are you high
oh shit dude
Yeah I'm pretty excited. I'm going on a sleeper bus though, which is a tadbit scary
Actually, bad analogy but it's a cool place
and Jaipur is kinda like the Jerusalem of India
our boss is out for the next few days hehe
And it's awesome, we're planning a trip to Jaipur and Agra (where the Taj Mahal is)
that's sick dude, my brother wanted to do something like that a while back but never went through with it
0.0 damn dude
What do you do during the week?
awesome awesome
I also haven't talked to my dad about it since I left for here, so not 100% sure the status
oo my bad, that's when I get back. So trip would probably be after the 25th
Probably like a week or two after I'm back, which will be July 18
not sure of the exact date but would you be interested?
Oh damn that'd be so much fun. Hey - my dad is doing a short hike somewhere in PA or nearby, probably gonna invite Kev + the lady + whoever else wants to come
I'll be in Puerto Rico with the fam 󾌣 why?
Bad bunch, those vagrants...
Oh wow I was totally off. I thought Bosnia was up there in that Estonia/Lithuania/Latvia crowd
Cuz Russia hates them right?
What's the culture like? Is it at all similar to Russian?
how so?
:0
although to be one hundred percent honest I have no idea where it is
I had some friends there they said it was insane
Oh shit
Bosnia?
isn't it just perfect?
with the 60 foot falls

Yeah dog, and Peace Rock as soon as we're all in one state
yep haha
the time difference is pretty crazy, it's 10 PM here
Yeah 100% absolutely
pictures looked so badass haha
Yo tell me about your euroventure
Yeah it's a cool idea, the mothers really like the necklaces too.
Apparently a lot of babies get vaccinated twice? or not at all? They just have no way of knowing cuz it's India and there's like 20000 different vaccines
so the healthworkers can just go and scan the necklace with a smartphone to update it/see which vaccines are needed
and they gave a bunch of them out in rural India
Sorta, this group built a necklace that stores a baby's worth of immunization records
I've actually been doing like 8 hours of programming the past 6 days it's horrible
so like 8ish hours of web development stuff
Mostly programming this week. I'm pretty useless in the field haha
Also I've been to like immunization camps where there's tons of disease and stuff
Hospitalized and stuff
Yeah he almost died
Also the tap water will like mess you up
Yep. Haha.
Shyam got typhoid last time he was in India 󾌯󾌯
Also a lot of diseases you can get
And I was running with my friend today and we got lost and like, had no water
Yeah, it gets pretty hot 11-3

Haha basically. But like, in this city elephants walk on the street
Trippy *
So triply man. 100% do it for the experience

In the north
And Udaipur
Food here is like $3-4 and you can stay in hotels for $12-15

It's pretty sick, I'll tell you more next time we chill. How was Europe? It looked awesome haha

okay that royally sucks. strike up a conversation with an interesting looking Turk
if you wait it out a little bit, either you'll get over it or she'll realize she's made a mistake
listen, if you do something now, it's only going to make stuff worse
won't see her until tonight or tomorrow
nope
find a computer and watch a movie
dude my advice: find a way to take your mind off it
oh wait yeah shit it's Turkey
sober up then worry about it
yeah dude this is why drinking is bad
dude you're not like drunk or anything right?
there are times when it's best to do nothing for a little while
or do something exhilerating
honestly, go down to the most xenophobic corner of turkey and sing our national anthem
watch a horrifyingly scary movie
don't think about her or you'll drag yourself down
dude promise me you'll think about something else for at least a little longer
like a week ago or something like that?
didn't really notice :/ i'm sure she is
don't worry I don't know of anyone else that knows outside of our inner circle
she told me :/
dude don't think about it too much?

the stubble helps, and chris's age looks ambiguous
yeah dude, haha worked really well actually
and boom, they'd hand me an abstract and start stuttering into a presentation
all i did was carry around a binder with a sheet of paper on it, and carry a pencil
and they thought we were judges and so they presented to us
Chris and I walked over to kid's boards
haha dude DelVal wasn't that bad
yes i'd say anything involving getting into S&M with Jesus Christ is toying with crossing a line
alright i think i got it
yes that's very S&M
so basically it's kind of like being raped, left powerless, but all the while being in a position of power?
i just sighed
chyeah
Hmm VLE says it's for tomorrow
oh btw do we have to read Middlesex part one tonight?
yeah like she clearly does not have a firm understanding of how this sort of thing is supposed to work
with Doc it would have been an A
this one though, I deserved an A- atleast
haha i deserved a B- on that
"wherest be thou?" ()
so it was like
i had an internal citation with nothing in it
like at one point
like the first one I wrote was total shit
i have much more to gain by rewriting my B+
that between my B- and my B+
it occurred to me
that fucking whore
B+
haha sarcasm doesn't transmit well
ahaha nope, dude just assume by default what I say is bullshit

the great thing about compsci is you can totally bullshit people
keep in mind i didn't do anything soooo
yeah it's not all bad
'tis
si
haha my b
same ratio
30 by 48 is the same
did you tell them what size? sorry haha
oh sweet
haha what did you get it printed on?
were you like "ho print out my board"
what did you ask them to do?
like, when you called them
?
so are you getting it just printed
for the board
so wait it's laminating we want?
rather than like on the spot bullshit
cuz i actually planned it this time
yeah it took way longer than i thought
haha wow dude it really does
like 5 APs?
but when i think of all the courses i'm doing i'm not so sure
eh i was planning on it
i called a bunch they were all idiots
haha phenomenal
which staples did you talk to?
haha alright and yeah me too
is that the same ratio?
it's supposed to be 44x72 and that's bigger than the allowed size
yo that template you sent me, isn't it too big?
yessiree it is
we have to understand their inheritance patterns, but do we have to know like which is which? As in, is it fair game to ask, "What is Marfan's Syndrome's Inheritance Pattern?"
and yo, we don't have to know like, anything about the diseases right?
but tests are up there too
i hate testes
wow did not know that was gonna be on the test
yeah
like the reverse of polygenics
yo what's it called when one gene codes for a couple traits
yo what time's vaulting til?

noproblem man

i would imagine so but he says she doesn't
he was thinking of asking Erica
eh good point
i think silvs should throw one
i haven't been invited to any
scary?
haha really?
and they go to pripyat
about these people who take an "extreme tourism"
there's a movie
extreme journalism can be your thing
do it man haha
haha yeah i think CNN started covering a lot of their stories and stuff
haha did you see the one on Mexican cinematography
and fuck yeah i want to
no haha from her soccer team
haha none of them were like smoking hot
so we got dinner with them and boarded with them a little
yeah she had like 5 friends up with her
and forgot about it
so it just looks like someone surgically implanted a turkey egg under his skin
this is below it
like it's on top of the skin kind of
in the actual skin
haha nooo a blood blister is like
haha all the ski patrollers said it was the biggest they've ever seen
like, it stuck out a solid inch and took up 1/4 of his forearm
and it was the size of an egg
swells up
or like when bleeding under the skin
the medical term for a bruise
oh and Alex might have to get his hematoma drained by a doctor
that'd be niiiiiiiice
so probably every run atleast 4 or 5 times he would high-velocity crash
and like 1/3 of the time he would face plant
but he was determined to go from a heel-edge- to a toe-edge like i can
able to almost get down without falling
he was like
goddamn
i don't think so
he was pretty dazed haha
i think he mighta been concussed by the end too
he's never been boarding or skiing
haha yeah i was teaching him how to board today
he literally slid on his face a few times
haha Silverman had some of the most epic falls i have ever seen
dude shoulda been there it was sweet
yeah ik haha i didn't do it thoughthanks
thanks dude
i wasn't there

we were supposed to do all four
i did the last three
did you do span?
wait
wait
good man
alright bud, keep it fresh
and a host of other horrible names, whilst you skewered head upon head on giant harpoons while celebrating ancient Mongolian rituals with your cronies in a blood orgy
they would call you the Genghis Khan of the UN
oh man you would be a great politician
go into politics man
none of that lab shit
it's the way to go
on hotpockets and mountain dew
2 in the morning
fuckin around with a computer until like
i'm tellin you tho man
haha good adjective
i promise you'd have more fun
get some compsci
dude you gotta stop with this Bio shit
haha probably
that's why we do it right?
it does
yep
honestly
either way I really don't like it
idk if that's dedication or just lonliness
just spent like 20 minutes making a fucking diagram
go for it hombre
yeah it's bad
when she's not off being a bitch
yeah she can be forgiving sometimes
we need like illustrations too
alright sweet
"20 mL are then poured into beaker A."
is it okay if its present passive voice
i believe so
yeah
is procedure for science fair in passive voice or like command form?
and you and kate have to present
cherise, sarah, and i have to lead class
good luck, and i honestly doubt you'll go
alright man i'm goin to bed
that's some weird shit
you know the president of Haiti is some druggie reggae dude named Sweet Micky?
who also supposedly doubles as the virgin mary or something?
specifically to a goddess Erzule?
a lot of religious references
mutilation, rape, etc.
yeah i'd put my money on vaginas
literally every girl in the character is physically violated at some point in the book
yeah everything has to do with vaginas in this book
right?
she had to get stiches in her vagina
that when Sophie had her little incident with the pestle
and you learn later on
like hooooooow fucked up is that
like, her pregnant stomach
and bled to death on the way to the hospital, all the while exclaiming that she couldn't have the child
that Martine locked herself in the bathroom, and repeatedly stabbed herself in the stomach
from Marc
Sophie has a message on her voicemail
the next day,
they all talk and have a good time and whatnot, but Martine tells Sophie she's going to have an abortion
Martine and Marc invite Sophie and her husband Joseph over to dinner
so one night
but is afraid of the thought of raising a child again, giving birth, etc.
she gets pregnant
which, by the way, she hates
has sex with her
so when her boyfriend Marc
including all men, etc.
Martine is like super afraid of anything that comes near her vagina
as a result
leading to the creation of Sophie
and her mom, Martine, was raped when she was 19
the main character is Sophie
so
there's like 35 chapters
chapter by chapter
eh it took me like probably 45 min in total to read them all on sparknotes
...
okay
do you really want to know?
like it makes the whole pestle in the vajayjay thing look like a delightful stroll on the boardwalk
up
fuuucked
insanely
massively
like
is fuuuuuucked up
the ending
goddamn
yo did you read the summary of Breath Eyes Memory?
good luck
haha alright peace out man
haha surprisingly, a lot of them really like metallica and KISS and stuff
like anywhere between 6 and 12
haha not those last ones
and the other half are like hardcore extremist atheists
and like half of them are jewish
there's a fucking muslim kid that comes to these things!!
and i'm like wtf Brett you can't say that shit
"A guy's ship crashes, and he's stranded in the ocean. After surviving in a life raft for days, he's passed by a fishing boat. They ask him if he needs help but he replies 'I'm waiting for God to save me'. Another boat passes by, and he replies 'I'm waiting for God to save me'. By the time a third boat passes, he's nearly dead but still replies 'I'm waiting for God to save me'. The next day he dies and goes to heaven. In heaven he demands to God, 'Why didn't you save me??' To which God replies, 'What do you mean? I sent you three boats!'"
this kid told all the other kids a joke that went something like this
god one time
the chocolate covered slaves
but no, apparently i was wrong, it was the slaves
and i was like, well for the most part it was a cultural infusion that started in the early 20th century with different ethnic subcultures such as African, Carribean, and European influences
he asked me if i knew where it came from
oh trust me that ship sailed too
it's politically incorrect as fuck though
soooooo yes more or less
haha well Harlem
one of them informed me that "Jazz music came from slaves"
i know dude they're terrible
yeah i don't think they absorbed any of it though
and i went and taught a piano workshop to a bunch of little kids about adapting pieces of music to an instrument
well they all went to Neemas to get drunk to the point where they passed out
haha literally that was the best match of my life
haha an at the end the first thing i did was look over at you and Chris
and stood up on that bitch
and i was like "fuck you malvern"
and then i heard you cheering
like a couple times haha
i got taken down like a motherfucker
and i remember like when i started on bottom
and i was thinking
so i could recycle some stuff for college essays
my mom told me i should write about it
when i got home
haha yeah i tagged you in it man
do it
that's like a high honor
you better'd fucking do it
oooh i like that
(AM)Erica
that's a thing
Erica
you do have like the Underwood SAmpson though
yeah
but i just focused on feminist ones
and i have 27 symbols for Balzac
erudite to the fucking moon
how fucking learned did that sound right there?
and since it's super hard to include shit like that in a movie, it kind of degrades the potency of the cinematographic adaptation
yeah
like when Gogol hides the grave rubbings, when he seese the pigeons in the trees, etc.
and i'm doing the namesake, and a big part of mine is how the director left out some really crucial metaphors
well i'm not done mine yet, but basically just talk about how effective the film version is
it took a solid hour to go through and find every one
i made a list of all the symbols in the book if you want to glance at it
oh sweet
kind of an anti-traditionalist metaphor right there
she gets bitten by a snake
*keys
when she tries to please Luo by diving for his kieys
yeah haha and like
it's all about literature enabling feminism
like how when the narrator gives a book to the gynecologist in exchange for an abortion
haha it's all symbolism
I'm doing feminist analysis of Balzac and the Little Seamstress
i think i actually remember you saying that
ahhh good choice
yo what's your 4-5 page essay on?
np man
G D F B H A E
yeah sure i can check
including childbirth
as is traditional in Polish celebrations
i'm going to just take a bath in a huge vat of lukewarm hot-fudge sauce
and when the semester ends
being done with SATs is a good feeling
same bro

speaking of which did you do English all day haha??
yeah this is fantastic news
including namesake review
anything due
for EVERYTHING

look at the list of english theories
and hmm

yeah on like a great night it can be up to like 90, and usually for regular lessons
and like, on a good night, for two hours of work, i get like 60 bucks?
i couldn't do year-round lessons because of wrestling =/ so i do like a weekly music class thing
Catherine's Music Studio in Skippack
giving piano lessons makes a shiiiiiiit ton of money

so i had to try a lot of places first
turns out she's a vegan

her powerpoint says the RER
the book/my notes say the golgi
*oligosaccharides
yo are glycoproteins added in the rough ER or the golgi?
yeah same

i think you can?
yeah dude :/
alright good stuff
but we have an in class essay tomorrow

Frida

i don't think so...
so i can get all those awards >:D
i made mine all about like computer security and shit
also
plus I'm sorta counting on my project this year to do better
yeah I hope so
but they would have liked to see that i'd done that
that's good
shit what's the prize?
or do you just present?
is it an actual competition?
i don't know about anybody else
i know I did...
uhm
no :/
especially since I wan't to go to Penn
damnit i regret not signing up now
are you?
but no haha
i really should have shouldn't i :/
ugh i forgot to schedule all that stuff
yeahman
does it take long?
yeah in my class it is
fantastic
oh
we don't have eng hw right?
>:D
wow did that just come from me?
>:D i wanna cuttabitch
if it makes you feel better we're both going through the same misery <3
me too man
you do spanish?
read that chapter and do some questions
i still have history and bio hw
and btw i only did the first half of it
so i needed to find the beginning/end of the chapter
but it had no chapter marks
i found an online version
okay thanks dude you're a lifesaver
can you tell me the first sentence of the chapter and the last sentence of the chapter?
do me a fav?
dude
wait
i fucking left my shit at school
yeah
did you do rosaura yet?
thanks bromandawg
alright man
and i made up a story about how my friend hosted a foreign big brother program and got a lot out of it
how the US helped the british before they entered WWII
i used how the St. Vincent du Paul Society uses like foreign charity to help the poor in Angela's Ashes,
like
and the examples have to be different things
anything else doesn't really matter
and it needs to be long enough to make a point
all three examples have to pertain to your thesis
a clear thesis
You have to have three precise examples
mah bad
*
nations
i said we should help out others
or something like that
Should we care about the interests of those in foreign natures, or should we solely spend our resources on our own nation?
haha
yeah
luck was on my side >:D
and i've heard that word so many times before but never goddamn looked it up
it was between that one, Philistine, and like soporific or something
didn't know it either
yeah i didn
yesiree
the Poly- part took precedence over the -math part
righto Tyler
and bingo
and i guessed Polymath
the word was to describe someone who's good at a lot of things
hmm interesting
really??
go for it man
?
like do you know what Philistine means
the vocab was hard
the reading kind of sucked though
btw the SAT was actually a pretty easy one
koolbreans
i did the same thing
yeah
are you reading all of The Merchant of Venice for tomorrow?
i know me too :(
also wrestling prevents me from studying
more people than that
uh
evelyn i know...
i'll take it again most likely
you bother me
ready for the SAT bud?
El vocabulario de Rosaura, al final del libro (los tres capítulos)
she said
i asked her about the vocab
?
that essay's definitely due tomorrow right>
no prob
A F H D
yeah two after break
no it's an orange soft cover book
which MIGHT be the vocab she was talking about
on the pages included in the email she sent out
you have to know all the verbs
well
yeah
remember them?
"Tu tienes un melocoton"
"Yo tengo una manzana"
like
we had to do some workbook exercises on the present tense...
like if you remember
and the first few chapters of our workbook
about what to study i think
and she sent an email out
i guess so...
" Incluirá: 3 capítulos de Rosaura y el vocabulario estudiado, el presente de indicativo y el uso de ser y estar."
and the test has indicative, 3 chapters of Rosaura, ser vs estar, and the "studied vocab"
less than a page double spaced
like
that doesn't seem too long honestly
200 palabras
and the Mayan essay is in spanish right?
alright
matt sorry to bother you man but what vocab is on the spanish test?
alright thanks dude
two pronged i believe
the other is just a default wall socket
one end looks kinda like a mini-USB port
hmm it's a black cord,
it'll be under one of them
and like a power strip
there's a little compartment for cords
under all the computers
either way haha
or actually you can get chris to do it if you want
yeaaaah
by one of the computers on the third floor
but i think i left my phone charger
i'm feeling pretty sub -par and i've actually been sleeping since like seven
so i'm probably not gonna be in school tomorrow?
little favor
can you do me a fav?
matt
and you have atleast two...
yeah and i have four tests
one week :/
yeah man good luck with that
and that's a fucking star destroyer
this couldn't fit on Mrs. Saurman's ass
like, Hamlet could fit on a postcard
nope
yeahhhh i was hoping for like "Hamlet" sized
like Angela's Ashes size
it is fucking dense
which is most likely going to happen Saturday Sunday Monday of next week
yeah except for reading 300+ pages in a week
i spend like forever on a page
i bet it makes reading Rosaura soooo much easier though
hehe
was AP Span Clit better or worse?
blaaaaah
yeaaaaah
alright peace dude
balls i still have to do spanish
yeah we do
we have the 8th off right?
hm okay sweet thanks dude
when do we have to read merchant of venice by yo?
167 i think
hmm i think it says on VLE but lemme check
is it all chapter 2?
gahh i haven't yet
hey'd you study for Bio yet?
alright cya man
so unbelievably not worth it
i think i've sunk a solid four hours into this so far
ooooh that's a good one
i'm not being like cherise i actually was writing it single spaced and then i double spaced it and was like holyshit this is long
do you think he'll mind if i go over a bit?
damnit mine's too long
so it's 2.5-3 doublespaced?
yo must we double space english?
Matt
alright toodloo i gotta study
but her quizzes are frkxn impossible
yeah the reading was super easy
i'm not sure though...
i think and questions pertaining to the story too.
that's what's worrying me
?
did you study for La Tomatina
and leaving the rest for tomorrow
i did like one and a half paragraphs
yeah definitely
yeah by 2:50
otay cya man
i think i might be at the bottom of the class...
yeah man haha i'm having regrets over joining this class
haha 86 on that mfckin quiz
unlike Spanish
i'm pretty happy with that
same actually
how'd you do on the essay by the way?
that's a good one
yeah
oh
whattabout you
i'm doin dat one
and he talks about like religion, his literary tastes, the english, growing up etc.?
you know the one where he talks to Mr. Timoney
feel free to use it
alright thanks dude
yeaaah that's it
Bildungsroman
oh i got it
i think so...
or something
like polydofisdhl
there's a huge ass word
The Odyssey was it
a story where the main character becomes a man?
matt what's the name of
alright i sent it to your GA email check it out foo
no but a tuppence will do
i'll text or call you when i do it
nah dude no proib

but it wouldn't be for a few hours
i could write them out to you
herm
like i think thirty :/
my scanner doesn't work :/
yeah never hurt anyone...
i'm just not gonna do anything
eh Cherise thought the same way
do we have english hw?
:v
yes
...
peace
as they say in Puerto Rico "Hasta los elefantes mastican los cojones"
ah gotcha
more or less than an hour?
how long did Span take btw?
and Spanish
alright dude i gotta go do bio
yeah but we didn't get anything done for like a week
like all of it
in Midsummer Night's Dream
and she made us act out everything too
yeah it's horrible
yeah she's totally biased
*Chris and me
and Chris and I like Bs and B+s
and she gave Ashley Leone STRAIGHT As and A PLUSES GODDAMNIT
"bullying" or whatever
she was also the one that cracked down on the Arjun-Anna thing frosh year
he wrote his own vow that you had to take to get into the hate group
haha he organized a "Burnett-hate group" and spent an entire free devoted to smashing on her in Jim's office
he realllllllllly hates her
haha talk to Arjun
say, for a certain story
is if you write an essay outlining why men are bigoted and biased in every way
the only way you can ever gain her trust
she talked about allllll her AP courses and how we should take them
every single day
and she's also horribly annoying
"No seriously, right now go put it in her office."
and she says
then i stare at her
"Really Tyler? Right in front of Debra Kennedy's office? You might as well just go put it in her office."
and she says
i had my phone out because i was taking a picture of the quote board
last week of school
unrelated
well first off i remember one time
she's vicious dude
yeah second semester Freshman year
a lot
she hates straight white males
yes
Burnett?
she hates me
i want to get as high a grade possible to average out with my second semester D+
oh hell no
yeah man it's gonna be a crazy year
and just walk into a meat grinder :/
yeah i'm afraid i'm not going to know when he's serious
interesting word. and I have no idea but Chris had him and he did pretty well
and neither will Doc
the lion never saw it coming haha
same idea, but much more efficient
mine is like a lion taking down a gazelle, and yours is like a lion taking down a gazelle with a crossbow
yeah just slightly different attacks
yeah that's pretty good
oo nice man
ooooh very clever
and those seemed to encompass the major effects on an individual entering a new culture
i said that it's a good choice for a Strangers In a Strange Land course because it dealt with: criticism for one's heritage (regardless of birthplace), religious prejudice and strife, and the difficulties associated with starting a new life abroad
and it'll say on VLE
how long does it take?
i don't think so
si
yeahhhhh haha
eh

eh
yeah she's nice but..
yeah :/ I like her as a person but as Chris's friend I feel like I have to be upset at her
well Devon and i have a love-hate relationship, i just always kind of assume Sophie hates me behind her back, and I'm still having trouble forgiving Evelyn for the whole Chris-Semi thing
yeah that's certainly a bonus. maybe her friends would hate me less haha
she's a cool gal
see we're kind of close already but not more than friends yet, but she seems kind of interested and her friends seem to think so. I think she's cute but i don't think were really on the same wavelength all the time
dude I have no clue if anything's going to happen to semi
haha not now
hell i don't know either
oh do you mean logistically or romantically?
and I have no clue
"You want to seem intelligent but make them feel smart too"

i think that's Luke...
you could be varsity as a senior
dude you were a pretty good wrestler
not his own weight; himself
i think he could bench press himself
he's just unhumanly strong
honestly i think Desmond isn't that good
yeah superclose
yeah haha he beat Marcus by like one point
haha he beat Coop
haha yeah damn so close
now he's a monster haha
he was big before

I'd definitely recommend it
*hints
like it's interesting to read, goes fairly in-depth, and there's like tints of humor in it
that one's by far the best
i've seen a few different coding-related books
Headfirst Java
i used this site while i was waiting for my book to come
http://www.javabeginner.com/
hey if you're actually serious about learning java

A F H D B C G

kerry seemed kind of upset though
yeah

aite
she'd know hopefully

yeah
do we need to bring in our story tomorrow?
for the "mole relationship in a decompisition lab" do we have to do the 4 followup questions
yeahh cya dude
until this bullsh#t
yeah same i thought i understood it all
i think hydrogen might be an exception
(the second term doesn't have a prefix)
Hydrogen Monosulfide
because its not
i guess you know its ionic
haha
he said Hydrogen Sulfide
yeahh but on the quiz thing
so are there just random exceptions
yeahhh
and i believe he said the only exception
ammonium is an exception though
but neither is a metal
so wait it's ionic? but it doesn't have a metal?
like i don't get it
how do you know that?
?
formula
dude what's Hydrogen Sulfide
gl tomorrow
yeah haha cya man
lol i've never met silvermans mom i bet shes hilarious
and you were like they could be prostitutes...?

yeah haha
cuz shes a weird woman lmao
yeah
a man is 38, has huge ears, has two daughters from his past marriage with a 17 year old hippie named sunny - and now hes married to a 60 year old hungarian-russian yodeler
a great characterization would be
she was like
for that example
like wtf
(sucks)
now this is a GREAT passage
(which sucks)
this is a bad passage
and she's like
and i was reading her examples in From the Ground Up
yeah dude oh my god
poetry is
literature is
well
i so agree with you
if you suck at it it's even worse
if you're good at it it's not that bad
like hating chem is one thing
i'm not even good at it haha
i hate it more

she is likely still in poland as we speak
allison moise lost her passport

but when they're in one they like to
like girls don't like to be provacative outside of a relationship
haha that's fucking ominous. dude the only difference is that girls need to feel loved first
I promise you haha
girls are just as horny as guys
trust me
might be awkward but do it dude haha

I'm worried

but the actual HOLE itself
like yeah, my ass cheek is
no joke
it's like a carpet
holy shit
my asshole...

haha bet mine are harier
so if you spurr hormone production --> harier
because hormones are made from them
like from fish and stuff

but like supplements or anything?
you on protein or anything?
that's how you get big
ahahaha good call niqqa

and does crossfit every other day
but she's like hardcore vegetarian
exception for like whole grains and stuff (hence the boulderpoop)
like basically no carbs and all protein
but, so like I've been on a crazy diet
ahaha no and I can outpace her in running
like she puts me to shame
dude so Jess is like the most insane fucking health nut ever
yeaaaaaaaah
make it make sense
yeah she's not feeling too great
that someone shoved a football through
dude it's like a drawstring bag
yeah even with the eyes
Onix*
that's what my poop looks like
wait, shit you know the Pokemon Onyx?
I'm pretty sure an obsidian coca-cola bottle came out of there
literally the stuff that comes out of my ass is volcanic in nature
dude I've been doing like high-fiber intake
dude I tried cutting weight and in a week I went from 142 to 136 so I'll have no problem
well I gotta be 132 by November
nah I'm exactly 140 right now
haha I wish I could
cuz I can't go over 140 really
but I'm not like much bigger

I'm invested now
like fill me in
and what do you do when you hang out?
dude when Tessmonster is around how often do you two hang out?
driving back from my gf's house
like ten min from my house
Like I was driving around it recklessly
and there were cops everywhere cuz it was at an accident
and it was 20 minutes past curfew
I was on the phone too
kinda weird I was strangely calm
actually not really
that look like cops, with vests n shit
like one of those guys directing traffic around an accident
I think he was a fire police so technically I don't think he could arrest me
so he let me go...?
and I said no
and he asked me if I was drunk
reckless driving-ish
I got stopped by a policeman
cluuuuuutch
wow dude clutch
what happened?
boom?
is that why?
ahahahahha
explain haha
I almost lost my job
dude that was fun
oh I ran a camp
yeah but that internship is good
like everyone is going to concerts and getting shwasted and throwing ragers and I'm coding
I feel like I've done nothing this summer
wow ouch
and my best GA friend in two months dude we should chill
nope a solid 3 weeks
I literally haven't hung out with like a GA person in almost 3 weeks
yeah let's do it
dude noice noice

You see it and it's like BOOM
I know haha it's awesome isn't it
Like she's doing the preserve at Souderton
She's like an environmental freak
Dude she and jack would be best friends haha
Haha I'm interpreting this as you don't think she's attractive
Haha no it's probs true
My brother flat out told me she's way too hot for me
Haha yeah, she's really nice and evidently too attractive for me so I should probably keep her around
>:D ill be taking her again
How'd SATs go?
Good good
What have you been up to
Ill fill in for you
That sucks
Why?
Yess
now imagine that in 1s and 0s
dude crazy fuckin shit it is
and they only pass it on if the number is larger than 0
so all three friends will pass on 98
and have them do the same
only one number less, so 99
and tell him to pass the number to THREE friends
100
give your friend a number
here it is ready
you ready?
this is a recursive function:
like hot as a hotdog warmer
and that stuff has a BITE
the spicy stuff
like as spicy or perhaps even spicier than your momma's Kim Chi
so fucking spicy
dude
recursive functions...?
dude have you ever encountered Recursion in your programming days?
oooooh yes
like it makes me viiiiiibrraaaateee
dude JavaFX gets me fuckin goin
JavaFX to be precise
dude nothing like some 6:25 hot steaming fucking java
good luck man
we'll get the same score no matter how we do
alright that's true
i hate when you outstudy me
ugh alright
haha how long's that
how much later you goion

what's that really abundant enzyme
hopefully we can BS the short answer
not this one though
keeps me in check
i like to get slammed every now and then
haha i really really hope
dude i hope we don't get slammed on this one
i know haha
dude there's no way she'll make it as hard as we're studying haha
damn dude so much
ugh
brb
haha
we're doomed
like oh my fucking god

what have you studied
wait hold up
go
patent it
one word
niggersauce
dude my blood runs yellowish orange with nigger sauce
NO YOU WON'T YOU'LL FUCKING MAAAAAAANGAGE
DON'T WORRY SIR I'LL MANAGE
it's like managing but it's for MEN
oh yeah she'll mangage
poor Tesmonster
like ouch, that must take a heavy toll on one's self confidence
like the level of mistakenness is equatable to that of a squid who thinks he's a bolemic chicken patty
like could not be more mistaken
like painfully, sorely, mistaken
and if she thinks for a second that she's riding in the front seat, she is sorely mistaken
now he gets it
good good
oh in that case you'll probably end up driving me
all the way?
like in a car?
wait what
are you driving Tesmonster?
i'm not going alone haha
okay well whichever one we're going to
idk if my parents will let me drive that far
haha what's wrong with Dorney?
like, it's not in this state
like New Jersey far
like suuuuuuper far
you realize six flags is super far away
okay FYI
jk she deleted it
and yes
yo what you up to
haha au revoir
good luck at the game
alright see you tomorrow
badass
i know haha
tis, tis
oh thanks man
hehe
okay shvat about the study guide
shvat

it's golemspeak for what
what about study guide
okay
oop
...shvat
when you said you're excited for skyzone
hahaha now i know what you were gonna say
good chat though
and i seriously have to sleep
alright i'll extend the invitation
yeah think that works
hold up
oh wait seriously?
people might be gone then
?
like a week after graduation
or i'll drive lauren or something
or i'll drive you and tes
either you'll drive me
understandable man, understandable
turnpike and the Northeast Extension which comes off it
in PA atleast
hahaha yeah
there's only one man ;)
haha *the turnpike
that's freaking highway shit
no way in hell
i'm not driving there alone haha
alright good little crew
but he's done a good job
not many people can make a comeback from me despising them
he's earned his place in my heart
no jk invite him
hehe
nah
alright so we have it decided
hahaha alright
like i wasn't gonna invite her to Skyzone but it would be awk if i didn't
haha like Kelsey assumes everything i do is like this underhanded thing to get at Morgan it gets on my nerves haha
haha dude i'm not like that into her
haha alright
haha
she doesn't
thats my 2 cents
i'd invite Tesa and 1-2 freshman, Lauren, Austin, Maggie, and maybe Jack
okay if you want to make it a comfortable environment
you do you
you're running the show man
hahaha
good with me niqqa
nah keep it GA
also out-of-school people is an option if you're interested
goddamnit
nah that's kinda lonely
why don't you two just go haha?
well that was easy
well who do you want to bring
want me to plan it lol?
haha you're doing this indecisive thing
and i can extend invites if you'd like
anyone going to Skyzone i'd entirely support
even with freshman
haha dude i won't feel left out
don't want her to feel left out
haha
if any
then i'd stay away from excessive juniors
haha okay if you want Tes to go
haha i'm cool with going with anyone
who do you wannt
haha dude this is your thing
it's true haha
she's fine
oh well she doesn't count
also my tolerance is directly proportional to how attractive the freshman is
haha i'll go as long as it's light on the frosh
so clearly she has not thought it through
well just junior would exclude her haha
who does Tess want to go
alright
fuck dorney
oh really?
wave pool and shit
like awesome fucking waterpark
cuz they have a sick water park
also we should consider dorney
other days yeah
saturday i don't think i can
actually
haha anyway yeah sure
not funniest
funnest
but it only sprinkled for like a few minutes
like i went on this day it was supposed to rain
you can go on any ride as many times as you want haha
with not a single person on it
an amusement park

it's amazing
going to six flags on a rainy day
one of the funnest things i've done

First, a computer was set up with a Lab Pro and two Vernier pH sensors. Then, 50 ml of Solution B (containing white vinegar and iodine) was placed into a 250 ml beaker. Glucose testing paper was used to test for the presence of glucose in Solution B, the results were recorded, then white scrap paper was placed beneath the beaker. PH sensor #2 was removed from its storage buffer bottle and placed into the Solution B (the cell environment). A 15 cm piece of soaked dialysis tubing was twisted and tied off at one end, and Solution A (water, starch, and glucose) was filled to a 4 cm mark in the tubing. PH sensor #1 was transferred from its storage buffer bottle to the inside of the dialysis tubing (model cell) before the outside of the tubing was washed and the opening of the tubing was tied off with a piece of string. Solution A was tested for the presence of glucose with glucose testing paper, and results were recorded. After confirming that the pH sensors were accurately reading to the computers, data collection was started for a period of 25 minutes. The pH

like she's your type of girl
and dude don't let the ZJ thing psych you out
not really but you're a bucket full of surprises these days
and if she could go she'd be like oh i can go...
or something along the lines of that
be like "I realize you might not be able to go to prom, but would you want to do something else that night? That way I have an excuse not to go"
dude this is how i would do it
it's actually unhealthy
haha dude if you know the extent to which i text some people
haha good good
i'm not advocating you ask over text haha i'm just curious
do you and her text much? just wondering
like idk take the bitch to olive garden
i would take her out somewhere else
honestly if she can't
like ask if she can go at all
i'd casually ask her first
uhm on that
dude if ZJ is half as bad as his brother you're doing them both a favor by not letting her at him
and let's be honest who would she be happier with...
you don't owe shit to anyone
fuck ZJ
go for her

it sounds awful
i actually have no idea
idk my mom wants me to
some fucking entrepreneurship program
write this goddamn essay
i have soooo much stuff to do
nope
so basically longer in every direction than you could possibly throw
my front lawn is like an acre
if some other guys come early frisbee would be another option
so we'll have no issue finding wood
and my woods are like the woods we made fort cat in
ideally,
yeah as long as nothing catches on fire we're good
haha yeah
oh that's another reason you have to come early
i'm excited for the bonfire
couldn't go
oh no he's coming haha
it's fucking addicting as shit
i spent a week listening to that song
i spent like
ugh i have to figure this all out tomorrow
we just got a brand new one and supposedly it's amazing
also i'm toying with the idea of turning on my hottub
>:) fuck them
haha that's me
ideally the girls could sleep in the bedrooms or in the basement
but i kinda want to sleep outside
i have a basement, three spare bedrooms
i also don't know what to do about sleeping
i have some booze from my bro but i'll try to get some more from him
ugh i have to go out and get food tomorrow
i'll be home all day
sounds good
be there like 5:00
but i want you to come earlier haha
eh i'm telling everyone 7:00
Kelsey, Evelyn, Shannon, Emily Smith, Sophie is 50/50, Kerry, Matt, Arjun, Kevin, possibly Jack, and us
guestlist right now is
sweet sounds good
yo can you get a ride saturday?
kk ciao
thanks mate
>.<
almost done my outline
alright man i'm off to do some essay
you got it man
i'd be more scared to meet like out of school friends or something
so that's like not quite as bad
i'm usually alright with parents though
yeah dude it would make me nervous
get on it man
haha
tap dat
and if they meet you they'll be fine
worst comes to worst, you have to meet them
haha could be man, could be
haha eek
and/or racist
might not...?
fuck parents
haha i'm happy for you bud
koolbeans yo
are you gonna ask her?
haha sweet yo
ok...
keep going
eww
what'd the fuckwhore say
okay go
she'd probably trust Miranda over me
she's a manipulative slut, and i know haha she's just closer to Tess
straight up front i'm saying that
also, btw i hate her and don't trust her
what'd Miranda say
jesus christ finally
it was so cool
my head is like bubbling though
and very strange but really appealing music playing in the background
all in timed increments, with as much food and candy as we wanted
then 10 minutes building stuff with popsicle sticks
but basically, Mr Rabuck and i spent 70 minutes talking about our personal lives
i'll explain more tomorrow
the Challenge GA thing
hi
Yo dat was so weird
the graphics, are fucking sick
and you fight off hordes of other monsters
as one of the little monsters
imagine being able to play starcraft
or like
+ Minecraft
Clash of Clans
it's
the game is fucking sick
but seriously
touche
no now
it's fucking sick
block fortress
check
is it available on android?
and also look at how sexy my cover photo is
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV5m7KvWUj0
listen to this song
get the game
haha make tomorrow the best
haha sorry man
like everything went right today
ever had that feeling?
dude today was like just the best day ever
systematics
the second one yeah
dude we already read bio hw
they're literally fuckin unstoppable
and it doesn't even fuckin die
it's fucking nasty
like
usually 1-2 seconds per building
like, 2 or 3 seconds per wall
can like take on an entire base
PEKKA
one
and dude
and he was like my levelish
some guy used to 100% me a week ago
Giant-Healer-Wizard
the
that scheme
so true
so net net wizards kick fuckin asshole
Dragons do 120 and take up 20 slots
Wizards do 90 dps and take up 4 slots
per storage capacity, they have like waaaaaay more DPS then dragons
haha like 12 wizards can pretty much take down anything in 1 hit
would stand a chance
nothing
for wizards
if i exchanged the goblins
dude
and due
it's just the wizard towards that can hitch you up
so the goblins are pretty much unstoppable
cuz mortars ALWAYS go for them for some reason haha
is they distract/take care of the mortars
the best part of the giants
and the normal Barbarian-Archer-Goblin scheme woulda gotten raped
i raped those last two guys
this strategy is fuckin fantastic
i'm on the uphill
dude i'm up to 940
but that's an anomaly, honestly
and they'll break through to the second wall
sometimes you can get lucky
little harder for them to get through
but internal walls?
yeah i do
giants suck ass at getting through walls
from that point on you just better hope there are no walls haha
but once you get to the mortars, the AA kicks in and the giants are on their own
so you can get like all the peripheral defenses
so it's hard to get to
people usually put their AA in the very center
both times, my healers have gotten shot down after a little while
the only flaw is
exactly
the giants like 15-20 k
the healer is 7k
it's a little more expensive though
and one goblin tower
8 giants left
i had like
i woulda gotten an 100%
literally, haha the timer ran out
like a CHARM
haha
yeah
FUCK YEAH
got 12 dark elixir too!!!!!!
works like a CHARM
dude this combo is fuckin SICK
150,000 elixir
130,000 gold
just got
yo
best one i've ever seen
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MY1iwXeBP38
haha have you ever seen good dubstep dancing?
and cyber goth and like darkstep are really similar
classical --> neoclassical --> goth --> cybergoth
and another is like
that's kinda one evolutionary chain
rave --> electronica --> house --> dubstep --> darkstep/glitch
like
covergent evolution though hahah
you do see like a lot of
in other directions it's not
i mean in one direction it is
it's pretty sick no?
the drop is like not quite as prominent in glitch i think
wait till you get the drop
dude
haha yeah Glitch Mob is the kinda leader in it i think
not for the fainthearted though,
Glitch Mob - Warrior Concierto
look up
if you want the perfect glitch song
yeahh
it's good as fuck
it's like coming out of dubstep
that's spreading
haha yeah dude it's this new genre
did you feel robo-dick?
yeah it's more glitch than dubstep
glitch/dubstep/darkstep
like
not even dubstep
it's pretty hardcore
big, angry, transformers-penises
...but only if you want feel like you're getting raped by transformers
Excision - The Underground
on youtube
listen to
addicting as fux
totally worth it
haha 99c
ahh gay
i'm not too far in though
so far i've gotten 3 stars in every one >:)
oh haha i only redo it if i don't get 1st
tiers
yeah haha
haha the max for me is like, three times
and i'm halfway there
three days
but you have to do it in the next like
i'm so fuckin close to unlocking this lambo
in asphalt 7
yo dude
very very true
his grades aren't motherfucking improving
goddamnit
and told me to do a better job tutoring BJ
three teachers have came up to me
dude in the last day
haha thanks babe
ehh haha
i also try like uber hard to try to get past it
but no, i honestly do feel pretty awk socially
i'm good
i actually knew you were going to say that
haha you know
i'd say outright awkward
and not just inept...
always haha
haha not sometimes though
me too brotha
>:) crazy fucker
idk i don't wanna scroll back up for it
who's is it?
nah it's pretty bad
it's just like dependent clauses all over the place
i think it might even be grammatically incorrect...
and it's so close to being disgusting in a good way
like in a bad way
but that first sentence is disgusting
the thesis is cool
when i get to a million elixir, i can get a dark elixir drill too
it's so fuckin sexy
i also gotta start nabbin dark elixir
so i can get higher level pussy
gotta get dat shit up
like 930 :/
and that was him haha
yeah especially when like i only got one guy that had over 100k of either

diagram 4 should be last
good man
okay
know she fucked the order up
but just
okay idk what you're saying
dooooon't
don't
yeaaaaaah
ya?
because at the END, there is a full polypeptide
she SHOULD have put diagram 4 labeled 6
i'm saying she made a mistake!!!
I KNOW
why would it start with a complete polypeptide?
because in Diagram #4, there is a complete polypeptide
Diagram #4 should be last
look at the ORDER
okay
she put diagram #4 as first
i think #4 should be last
look at number 17
yo
we didn't learn it
idk
but that's retarded
i got the answer sheet
yeah haha
haha
TATA Box
like wtf it can be either
promoter
for
"Region of a DNA where RNA polymerase binds and transcription begins"

ah gotcha
hi

oh
and a tRNA

god this nigga is finally done
all you other slim shadys are just imatators?
y'all act like you've never seen a white person before
ooooh no
0.0.0
thxboo
mmHg/sec?
what are the units for the rates?
damn's right son
After conducting the experiment, it was determined that yeast cannot utilize all the carbohydrates to an equal extent. Glucose, since it requires no breaking down previous to respiration, was metabolized the fastest. Sucrose, which is a disaccharide, must be digested by enzymes first before it can be used as source of energy (it is broken down into glucose and fructose) and was therefore digested at a slightly less rate. Maltose is also a disaccharide, composed of two glucose molecules, but the process of breaking it down via enzymes requires more time than that of sucrose, so its rate of metabolism is even slower. Lactose, the third disaccharide tested, was digested into galactose and glucose at an even slower rate. This suggests the idea that the certain enzymes necessary in yeast to digest various disaccharides either operate at different rates, or are readily available in different quantities. Starch, the last carbohydrate tested, is a more complex polysaccharide composed of many glucose molecules linked together in a larger molecular structure. Because of its large size, the yeast molecules were unable to consume individual starch molecules and therefore could not metabolize it at all. The control, the solution consisting of just water, contained no nutritional molecules and therefore its rate of metabolism was virtually none.
a looooooot
>:)
hahaha
not talkin about that bud
yeah
i'll edit it later
that's my blurb
Yeast is an organism that is used in many daily applications, such as the creation of alcoholic beverages or the leavening of baked bread. Therefore, it is advantageous to have yeast in a more condensed form where it will not degrade as quickly. To get yeast out of this deactivated state, it must be incubated. The incubation adds heat to the yeast and starts its metabolism, allowing it to digest sugars and carry out respiration.
trust me haha
you need to activate the yeast dude
like unbelievably wrong
that is soooo wrong
god no
you mean?
yeast?
what'd you say for number two?
i'm just thinking here
yeah
is it broken down?
what happens to the fructose?
when sucrose is broken down into glucose and fructose
probably
yeah
i might change it
that's what i have so far
switch results and prelab
i should do that shouldn't i...
not at the beginning
i put prelab before analysis though
yeah
yesiree i assume so
duh
oh
oh we don't have to actually find the rates?
how are you doing the last prelab question?
christophe
but i can see where you're coming from
haha i could've done better
nope
like a Mexican gets a leafblower going
gets me going
mmm
your fine ass
oooooooh yes
we could never work together
that's good news haha
you?

1080 p
not HQ haha
we want HD
and one is literally a definition level
i know one of them is like an adjective
eh i can never remember the difference
HQ torrent?
find a good version
i have faith you can too
if my dad can do it
dude
torrent versions are meant to be high quality
the streaming version is meant to be downloaded fast enough that you can watch it
what? no not at all
even my dad torrents movies
just torrent it
no
what?
streaming sucks
i can't do anything under super HQ
no literally
none of that live-streaming shit haha
yeah see if you can torrent like a high quality version or something
want to?
haha not yet
nope
si
and then you microwave them
and you pour hot sauce on them
you get fries
alright man
the last one is a wildcard
fuck it maybe all four!
or maybe a bacon pot pie

alright brb i'ma go make some hot fries
i'll be 220 by senior year

fuck i wish i were 220
same man
haha i don't think Neema's gonna wrestle in college
unless i go to some crappy D2 or D3 school

divide the molecular weight of teh whole protein by 100...

or basically how many polypeptides are in each protein
and we have to find the polypeptide weight
pretend that she already did that, and just gave us the protein weight
remember she said to find the weight of the protein by multiplying by 4?
what you have to know for two is

let me call you
can you do it?
yo dude
what you did to contribute to the play
ok its like
brb
haha i asked
uhm
shit i totally forgot that
cya
ok
otay
got it?
use negatives
five
then you might see it somewhere else
but if you look from another
then you might see the image at one place
if you look one place
thats not right either
no
and theres not one virtual image either
then there is no REAL image
is closer to the lense than the focal point
if the object
theres not only one image
*focal length
u realize virtual image depends on vantage point right?
np
dist from focal point
so yes
theres only one focal point
did you get the real image?
so u got it?
oh
lemme try drawing it
theres one focal point lol
not to the lens
make sure ur using Si is the distance from the Object to the FOCAL point
?
si
sure np
then their the same size
and since their distance is proportional to size
so theyre both equally far from the lens
then So is f
so if Si is f
Si * So = f^2
cuz
thats easy
oh
or the focal point?
2 focal points away from the lense?
lemme see
wats the q?
which one?
yes
for simple answer
i think
i think
yeah
what?
fun haha
oh haha
you put the lil pictures down and it tells the sprites what to do
where you do
like

The Great Purges have one other main victim.
try saying that in present
The Great Purges had one other main victim – the remnants of the Old Bolshevik group. His reasons for condemning the once revolutionary heroes were twofold: his deep paranoia and hunger for power got out of control, and the Old Bolsheviks he felt were the only power figures that knew his weaknesses and had any power whatsoever over him.
that would be present
Stalin then tried to eliminate the Kulaks.
you wuold say
Stalin now tries to eliminate the Kulaks

being asexual is like being lesbian but you don't like girls
haha i don't think your asexual if you had a boyfriend xD...
its a sexual preference...
no like literally the denotation of asexual is when you don't like guys or girls sexually
and no you're not repulsive :)
not other's lack of sexual interest in you
you realize asexual is lack of sexual interest
that's not asexual hehe
wait rlly?
you liked a guy who was asexual?
she's asexual
and as it turned out
she's like a girl version of me

In this video, you tagged a bunch of people but not me
Know what's weird??
everything you ever need to know about databases http://en.tekstenuitleg.net/articles/software/database-design-tutorial/intro.html
Ouch haha. Keep at it my child
Not Java?
What language?
Haha pretty impressive
Haha she's a highschool teacher so not that big
isn't she at Curtis and Temple too?
she mentioned Elizabeth Hainen
she's a renowned harp teacher in NJ, name was Nancy Sillinger or something. she said she knew a lot of the big harp teachers in PA and the main one or two at Curtis. who's your harp teacher now?
HA thanks. talked about you to a stranger on a plane today
Okay I'll bite who is this fucker
bitches
bitch
I'll fuck you up
no right?
do we have a stat test tomorrow?
okay
seriously
what's his name?
shwat
I'm delicious
Hiii
it's jess on tyler's comp:}
hi helen!
❤ Ciao Helen
Ill think though. We'll reconvene tomorrow
Haha brushing teeth
Hahahaha damn Helen never saw this coming
Ahahahaha what is it
Yeah it's not bad
Talking to you
Hi
Idk he's not showing up on fb
I can't see it
Haha I know
She's super fucking smart
She just reminded me that there are people that I get along with
Yeah but we won't be a thing either way
No like her not understanding me
But like I couldn't talk to her without it being weird
Like she's a great gf; super loyal, sexy, great bod, just wants to make me happy
Like I like her as a girl, but I could never appreciate her as a friend
No I mean I honestly believed it'd work out
I figured it'd be a rewarding experience
Since day one lol
Tomorrow decides
That'll decide it I guess
I'm seeing her tomorrow
And eh
I don't know about it
Like pink hair? Wtf
Like and she's so weird
Like I feel like half the time I'm with Jess she's just talking and I'm tuned out
And there's this girl at camp that is honestly the perfect girl for me and it's making me think how Jess and I are so incompatible
Which is the opposite of me
Like she's a rebel who wants to be different at any cost, she hates conformity and wants to live a la bohemia,
Like she's funny and she's a sex kitten but she and I are so different and at our cores we're really different
Dude idk about me and Jess
Dude can I tell you something too?
No problem babe
No haha it's fine, listen Helen you know it's not your fault, and doctors are smart and they always do their best. Beyond that it's all her
That's ridiculous
Damn I'm sorry Helen :( just know that it could never be your fault
Oh shit :/ how bad
Haha yeah go for it I promise
Yeah
Haha wtf?
PFEW
Last day of camp
Fuck I had a meh day
Haha sweet
Brb nappy nap
There we go
Btw
Bye
Byw
Haha great, how'd you do on sats bye
ahahaha what a great guy
and HE GAVE ME AN A+
he's like yeah, why not?
I'm like, really??
well if you get an A+ on the exam I'll give you an A+
and he was like
and we calculated it was pretty much impossible for me to get an A+ for the year
I talked to Mr Nelson before the exam
dude
and SATs are out
grades are back!
dude
oookey
nap calls
okay honey
like he's not threatening
but he's thin white and kinda scrawny
like if he were a big aggressive douche I'd be protective as fuck
nooo
like I realize there's a much greater chance of him being a bitch and emotionally neglectful than there is of him being aggressive or assholish
I just don't feel the need to be protective with this particular male
haha of course I'm protective
danks boo
so it's understandable that he's protective of Jess
like there is waaaaay more danger of me being a douche than Nathan
he won't
<3
if he does haha
like him being douchey or overly aggressive
haha I just don't feel like that'll be a problem with him
<3 if you ever need me boo
well you know I'd kick his ass
like if Nathan is all protective of Jess should I be as protective of you?
if you want that
I can be
should I be more?
haha I'm not protective enough of you
he's not too wild about me
to keep Nathan busy!
i need you
:(
I'll go if you do
please go
why can't you?
yeah she's nice
hung with her till like 4 today
nopez
and we get along really well
she's cute and honestly pretty nice
haha honestly fine with either
but like he's that type that would totally cockblock
(kidding on the gay thing)
he'll be a cockblock
yes but he's gay
idk how I feel about Nathan
and she wants me to go to the beach tomorrow
yeah i hung with Jess today
hahaha mom said she didnt care
ahahaha porn related to ponies
haha having a pair of testicles
haha he is
ahahaha
awkward
it's so much fun
also say La Campanella out loud
please tell me you guys have a thing <3
okay more importantly what's the deal with you and Nathan
whaaatsup
hiiii :)

no it's perfect
yeah haha it's like so happy
the song is so touching
i sound like austin
haha
isn't it so good
and the guy who wrote this song is Matt Bellamy's dad
it was inspired by this song
Knights of Cydonia
if you know the song
it just played in Mad Men and i'm like omg i love this song
but it's like so addicting
it's like a really old 60s song
Telstar by the Tornadoes
know what's a really really good song?
haha i know :(
she is
how's the mom
these days
what are you up to
just bored

helen
LOVEYOUBYE
GOTTAGO
HOMEWORK
OKAY
eh not you specifically
annoying
really
really
like really
idk they find them really annoying
like omg if you knew haha
passionately hates your friends
like
everyone from my friend group
but admittedly
your friends and me
we're really different
haha that's okay
am i missing any?
haha did i get them all?
Caroline...
Reena
possibly Tyler Thurlow
Leah
Helen Berhanu
alright
who else dislikes me haha?
Natalie
Alicia
like
okay not that many people dislike me...
i know
borderline arrogance, really
as a matter of fact i'd say i might have too much
haha luckily i don't have the problem
confidence goes a long way
haha that's true
it's the shier ones that are usually nicer
like aggressive guys are assholes
idk
yeah it's kind of weird that girls like aggressive guys
hahaha you little sexpanther ;)
sooo awkward
if neither of them can talk
like you know when between two people
but like that's good sometimes
haha i know
i just like to hear myself talk haha
like i can practically talk to myself
i need a girl that's just kind of shy and laughy
like, with a girl
i gravitate towards crazy ones -.-
that's why so many of my fucking relationships do not work out
like I kinda do well with a more timid girl
like
haha yeah
i feel like timid men do not compliment you
alright, continuing
haha the neighbors would complain
like really, really, good sex
we would have hot hot sex
haha we would be a great married couple
admit it it's true haha
like borderline rapey
you need a super super overbearing male
which do you choose
that's good
no you have lots of courters
wow
i feel like you need a really really forward man
haha you have a lot of courters
connor who
jimmy who
what about jimmy
jimmy?
go
haha okay
boring
wow
what have you been up to
no no tell me
how have you been
i gotta go start hw
alright
i need to get more of this shit down on solid ground
haha i do
and it looks fucking epic
did a back handspring on the polevaulting mat
front flip
like i got a layout down on the trampoline
recently i've been like really into shit like that
still on the polevaulting mat
hahaha we don't quite have it down on solid ground yet
it was fucking epic
yeah haha
it was pretty sweet
and i went into a sicknasty backflip
and he like pulled upward while i kicked off
and we counted to three
so he like cupped his hands, and i put my left foot in his hands
okay
lalala
lalallaa
ANYWAY
that is suggestive
wow yeah
^ this girl haha
and like cup his hands...
i had him like bend down
Chris and I did the sickest thing
oo today though
haha far from it
like horrible
i'm like, really bad
pole vaulting is taking a toll on my self esteem
haha pretty good
shortcomings
haha other people?
and people are really respectful
because they start like opening up and stuff
do super well in college
like people who are timid in high school
no i'm serious!
haha it's okay :) you'll blossom in college
are we? haha
we're not good with members of the opposite sex
oh well
don't like it
yeah haha
hmm feels weird thinking about her now
which is odd
enter my mind at all
today she didn't even like
actually its weird
haha yes i'm sure
yeah that too
i'm over it
yeah probably
haha no it's fine
emotionally neglectful
yeah haha that actually is a pretty good summation
also she's slightly superficial
she's not good in relationships
because it was weird
i'm just ending her and my relationship
and i'm not turning my back on her
it's mainly just Kelsey
haha that sounds harsh
for the sake of my own well being
and turning my back on them
i'm in the process of realizing all the people that make me angry in the world
i'd rather you not mend our friendship actually
no haha don't worry
just because it's innate doesn't mean you can freely be a douche and not be accountable
but that's like saying Sam Levin is excused for being a douche because it's part of his personality
like i get it's part of her personality
you can't say that's not flirting
like uh...?
then goes back to her seat
pinches my nose
ponders it
asks me some pointless question
stands like with her legs against mine
walks all the way around the table
and instead of asking me a question like a normal human being
she was wearing like, insanely short shorts
in history
like Monday
dude she flirts with me and she hates me
that's what they do
she's an attention seeker haha
is flirting 100% of the time
Alicia
she was flirting with Nathan...
and made it even worse by acting like nothing happened
she was a total dick to you
she should feel bad
she has lost her right to a correct pronoun
yeah
what'd it say
]mnbvmjhfkjh
khkh
yeah go ahead
what's she saying
did she call you
what happened?!?
why?
what happened?
okay goo
haha thanks helen
yeah haha she did
haha what specifically
not a problem
like the whole Molly thing
i can just have no emotional attachment
like with some girls
i don't get it
ahhh
well i'm kind of the same way
yeah haha
but at the same time won't let you get close enough
where they keep someone close enough so that they can never let you go
but some people (me in middleschool) can do this thing
and today, i would never do this
but there's something attractive about turning someone down
like i feel awful saying this
no honestly it's deeper than that
it's this sick, perverse pleasure
i did it to Natalie all throughout middle school
and i know she's doing it
idk, i try not to be
especially when they don't want you to get over that person
like, sometimes it's just hard to get over a person
a huge part of my depression
she's just like
not hate
initiating this flood of antipathy
and then motherfucking kelsey texts me
wow i was over it
haha no prob girl
i like you both
good
much more than most
and you both have heavy senses of guilt/morals
you both have really high sets of morals
conscious
you're both pretty smart but are really self-concious about it
you both definitely need stability
hmm
you criticize yourself alot
haha yeah
you both have a quirky sense of humor
both really kind but at the same time a little self-destructive
hmm both gingers
dammnnnitt
damnit
Do we need results for the lab?
Hold up brb
how so haha?
like totally
you are haha
you're Pam
haha isn't it?
yeah haha
like i fucking hate that
it's really superficial people that do it for me
what? no you're the opposite for me
haha have you ever met someone who just like, always ends up making you feel depressed?
like, little happiness leeches
also, it helps to recognize people that bring on depression
yeah it does
?
dopamine haha
really really helps depression
exercising like
oh hey btw
i can't wait till summer
hola
blah
but idk, it just doesn't do great things to me
it would be fine
if i ever get over my depression
i mean i feel like
yeah :/
haha my happiness level
that drops to like 20% of the time
but whenever i like drink it all
i just know that like, normally i'm happy 85-90% percent of the time
and i don't think i'm like, suffering? from it
so yeah it's uber bad
i could name 10 guys in my family that have either drank themselves to death, or quit drinking forever
like, all the way back
haha every single male in my extended family
like forever haha
like entirely
toying with the idea of quitting alcohol
i'm like
that shit's nasty
nono eek
<3
well if you ever need to talk i'm here okay hon?
but like, certain things bring it out you know?
hmm, i struggle with it
urgh
like i'm pretty sure every single person in my extended family suffers from depression
genetically, i'm like hugely predisposed to be depressed?
haha did you know that like
ugh rough weekend
actually i've been better
haha yeah i'm fine
i feel like i don't convey to you how much i appreciate you
like seriously though
<3
haha hey have i ever told you i love you?
thanks helenbear
alright
/how long is it
how did you start your lab?
wow did not even cross my mind
IM NOT DOING BIO RIGHT NOW
IM NOT W
and you'd have to calibrate it with water
yeah i think so
holdon
mmhmmmm
i did
np
yep
because they are in acetone
but in this one its acetone-based pigments
and if you used water, it'd calibrate it for a water-based pigment
so it's basically ensuring that it's only recording changes in the absorption spectrum from the PIGMENT, not the acetone
essentially it's the same as hitting "tare" on a scale
oh and the blank is used to calibrate the spectrometer
okay
thanks darling
<3
like that little table
hey could you send me a picture of our results btw
god i love internet
is it online?
wait uhm so it turns out i don't actually have my bio binder
I HAVEN'T EVEN LOOKED AT IT
figures
ugh
oh okay thanks sweetie <3
ANSWER ME DAMNIT
how long is that?
wait just discussion right?
is it extensive?
no which one is it?
hi Helen
haha yeah i'm happy as a porcupine meeting a pineapple
<3
is the word i'd use
like, elegant
haha
jk
surprisingly
you look good too haha
oh hey so i watched your harp vid its AWESOME
trying to push a car
haha dumb poles
my dad and i had to get out and push it out of the way
eh there were a few honkers
i did barely haha
grahhh
(i'm bitching to you about my own problems)
haha
given the current situation
which is ironic
i hate people that take their personal anger out on others
gah
and that bitch is on a power trip
like wrestling normally tames this desire
haha like this is bad
really need to get into a fight
really
like i really
ugh
and i can't get shit done
this is not healthy
i have pent up anger
or get into a fight
like i need to break something
idk why i'm so angry
i need to work on my resilience
wow it does not take much to make me upset does it haha
gah this day
and track was horrible
grrr
that's not a picnic at 11:00 at night
it's a quarter mile walk
like, jesus i'm taking out the trash for your lazy ass
because i took the trash out at 11:00 last night and it woke her up
like her reason was
and she literally took my phone for no reason
grr my mom occasionally is just in like a bad mood
:(
i'm not having a good day
errrrgh Helen
or have questions haha
i'll text you if i get finished early
hey okay i have to go finish bio
and i'm in sporadic little sexual relationships that usually go abysmally poorly
he's had like a steady gf for two years
well
we're too different
eh we just don't talk about girls
and Jason and i don't talk about girls
Kaylie would get annoyed if i tried
he'd be weirded out
honestly i can't talk to anyone else about shit like this
i'm glad we can talk about stuff like this <3
haha yeah
<3
/her on top of me hehe
so it was like more, face to face?
especially if only the girl has a pillow haha
eh spooning's like kinda uncomfortable if you're the big spoon
like not in a sexual way
and not to be too descriptive, but like sleeping with someone is a great experience
as in gigantic
haha she has pretty nice boobs
haha yeah not really
no regrets
eh
literally
yeah, like, spinning in circles drunk
she was fuuuuuucked up
do you know Molly Evans?
yeah it's pretty bad
haha he's like, oh man we're brothers now Tyler
which is like flat out disgusting
i know right? and the worst part is Zeke hooked up with her too at the party
honestly i don't really talk to her much haha
oh, uhm
and i know she definitely doesn't like me either
ahaha hell no
like eek
like the whole Molly thing
i feel like a slut a little though
well thanks <3
haha not really, but it felt good
like, i am not cool enough for this party haha
i got this weird feeling that like "oh hey i totally do not deserve to be here"
but when people are like having sex, getting high, consuming large quantities of alcohol, passing out, throwing up, etc.
like on the inside, i know i'm not
i felt very cool
uh
haha
hehe
hehe
i'll let you make a copy for yourself
?
i'm guessing you didn't
and i assumed you made two haha
well jeez ya coulda asked
^_^
i have yours
so unless you made two copies
because mine is like colored in, and i definitely never colored one in haha
i think i stole the graph from you...
well i have the graph
did you do the lab
do you not have it
i thought they were all +
?
like were all blocks positive
for results what was the glucose testing results
adios
ciao
aw<3 thanks
haha good
bye hon <3
i've mentally ruined you enough for tonight
i should study history
alright
but like physical vaginal sex? honestly don't see it
like, sexual things, yes
and honestly, i personally have no desire to have sex itself
and i'm just realizing that she's totally wrong, and it's all power, and self-image and self-projection
but like, she tries to get the message out that it's NOT about power, and shouldn't be
and i know, she's in my head
no i'm serious, like i actually think it's some sort of power trip
like the more i think about it, the more i think it comes down to just like power roles and such
haha nah every now and then i'm reminded of why i tolerate girls
i think i might be aromantic
maybe i'll just find a random Souderton girl
i hate it
haha being a virgin is really emasculating
with guys it's the exact fucking opposite
with girls, the longer you're a virgin, the more guys like it
see you have it easy
ugh
but that's because I'm a virgin, and i don't want a girl that's gone further than I have
yeah
but i could never like a girl non-virgin
well, guys always prefer virgins
yeah i know
but that's only because i'm a virgin
part of it is that, if a girl isn't a virgin, i can't find her attractive
just get it the fuck over with haha jesus Tyler
i don't want to be a virgin damnit
mreep
i mean like honestly, if i could get a better girl wouldn't i have found her by now?
Kaylie thinks she's not good enough
haha go for it
yeaaaaah haha
she goes to school with the Obama Kids
no haha Sidwell Friends
eh her name's Maia
like jeez thanks Kaylie
and Kaylie was like uh uh no we're finding you a different girl
like, there's this one girl that like, would be okay with it
no no i agree with her
Kaylie says i have to haha
there's so much pressure, honestly
i feel like i have to lose my virginity
haha i guess that's a yes
can i be honest with you?
just me and my weird relationship with society
i've been in a weird mood lately
haha i'm alright
english was killing me
i was in an uber bad mood
i'm sorry for being a dick :(
I called you and you didn't pick up
Haha naww
Haha alright

so, what you're saying is, you find me incredibly sexy?
because i set your hormones ablaze <3

perhaps involving you putting your face somewhere else
imagine it would be something really dirty
but if i could
i can't do anything with that
tis true
yes
whilst i was plowing you
that's not what you said monday night :(

let me rephrase
it cant be good
somethings not that bad

(win)
hey! i talked to sophie for like five minutes today
hey love
ok love you
natalies on fb
hey can you switch to aim?
haha perhaps
more of just a nerd
and im not that smart haha
so hes living in a world full of retards
compared to him
99% of the world is basically retarded
haha because i mean for him
you know i feel a little sorry for the dude
and you know its not that great haha
albert einstein was depressed as hell
i mean
you know i've learned being smart is a curse
there are a million peple with the IQ of 80 a thousand times happier than me
im sure
i mean
obviously im not 'amazing' or i'd be happy
yay im an ungrateful prick
or maybe im just an ungrateful prick
or im really really really ugly or something
like theres either something very very wrong with me
i know its not that bad i just cant be happy
it sucks
i hate my life
i mean literally
why
its nothing new
its okay i normally hate my life
nah
okay thank you love
but i hate complaining to you
i know you say that
always depressed and never happy and always complaining
and its really annoying sometimes
is the same way natalie acts towards me
i feel like the way i act towards you
i hate complaining to you
no
she can be silverman's problem
fuck natalie
w/e
oh
you don't
no just say you love me back
your gonna make me even more depressed
stop it :(
meh :( i love you
ah idk :(
gah i think i just want a girlfriend so badly that
it does
tell me the honest reason
alicia why dont girls like me :(
and it sucks dick
ik
i realize your losing respect for me by the minute
yeah
so he just dies of starvation
and he cant decide which to go to
and a bale of hay on his right
and theres a bale of hay on his left
theres a donkey
and just dies of starvation
its like the camel stuck in between two bales of hay
so why does it matter right?
theoretically ill be happy either way
and i mean
that the only way i can be happy is by choosing
and it basically says
its called the Synthesization of Happiness
idk
maybe it was 15 minues
/watched
you know i listened to an eight minute video made for just this situation
stop that >:(
idk!
two years?
dignity has made me single the last year and a half
yeah dignity sucks
but then nobody else likes me
but then i don't like her
so i should
but what guy turns down a girl when he can get nothing better
i mean i know i shouldn't
literally i am so goddamn confused
i don't know!
you saying you love me because were best friends
thats not like love thats like
but
well you do
nobody loves me :(
what else is new
fuckin great
im single
then what?
ok listen if i say no
ugh
i mean
yeah
i hate feeling like im settling for someone
this is so depressing
meh
wtf am i thinking
i mean
and for matula natalie's pretty good
i mean i must have the physical attraction of matula based on my track record the last two years
well i sort of define desperate
it sucks
ive been lonely for a year
i mean
and theres another im not spposed to tell you about
and i guess alex sorta
she turned down sean
but i mean
i know you think that shes just trying to get anyone she can
i have the same biases though
yeah thats also part of the reason i don't wanna go out with nat
what haha you didnt wanna date me
i mean its not like im settling for someone i don't like
i don't know :(
(
)
i mean by that liz
nobody else likes me thats worth it
i have the option to either be single or have a girlfriend?
does this make sense
but i mean
thats the hard part
i'm so confused :(
i don't know
idk im confused
she said she didnt wanna go out with him cuz she likes me too much...?
thats a good question
and jasons like you should
and she wants to go out with me

if theres one thing i could say that could help what would it be?
aww love!
like could you fall asleep now?
even with insomnia?
how much do you usually get?
do you want me to be mad at you so you can go to sleeep?
omg i feel terrible
meh is it my fault?
you need to go to bed
k listen my lil insomniac
:)
haha
trust me you have nothing to fear with me
im like haha yeah man
"- everyone is right?"
"im kinda self concious about my penis"
*yesterday
but neema today was like
dont tell anyone
haha ok
haha you know it
:)
ill bring a lil knife
the bigger their knife, the smaller their penis
haha my dive instructors attitude is
yeah you actually dive with a knife
im gonna be PO'ed haha
if i get bit
ugh fuckin morays
god im actually really scared now haha
whats scary is they wont try to avoid you haha
thats like five feet by five feet
Nomura = 450 pound jellyfishy
nah theyre peaceful i think
Nomuras hehe
know whats scariest
out of anything diving related
what would scare you the most?
im already afraid haha
that and man-o-wars
no exagerration
its impossible unless you physically cut its head off o.0
if they bite you you cant get them off
omg 0.0
morays
fuck sharks
i dont care about sharks
those things scare the fuck outta me
fuckin morays
know what im scared of?
kinda scary
haha like six feet
*dat
haha the biggest was a foot bigger than him
my dads seen like 50 or 60
supposedly you usually see one per dive
theres a better chance my lungs will explode then ill get hurt by a shark
a shark isnt an issue at all
know whats weird?
*
dat
haha yeah im hopin dat
that deep
you'll implode :(
: ( and eventually end up on the botom of the ocean
like youll slowly start sinking faster and faster
youll actually start falling in the water haha
if your weights get stuck
ooh ready this is a good one
haha im a lil scared
usually strokes or ruptured lungs
1/10 of scuba related deaths are from drowning
but only like
yeah
and if your buddies not around youll either get a stroke or drown
and if your purge valve sticks you have no way of getting air
and if you stay down long enough and your kinda light (as in you don't way much) and you get nitrogen narcosis you'll get drunk and most likely get confused and possible drown
or run out of air
and likely drown
and fall unconcious
you'll slowly get decompression illness
likewise if you go to 140 feet for more than eight minutes
and you will suffocate in your own blood
and tear
your lungs will explode
and if you ascent more than five to ten feet while holding your breath
if you go up at more than a foot a second your body gets filled with bubbles and you die of a stroke
haha im so scared for scuba diving
wow
google brings up like 4 definitions
:)

haha your no fun alicia :)
then you add the same to yours?
ill add five...or ten minutes to mine
how about this
ok lets make it fifteen
do i ever get the honor of being reminded why I like it that you play piano?

haha tight skirt :)
:)
so im playing piano... :)
nooo you have to :)
hehe ;)
(like always)
haha ok :)
mmhmm ok
ook go :)
everything up through -4 you still wouldnt
yeah
pleaseee :) i went through all that haha
;) ok your turn
but for that youd really have to be in the mood
ill discover that i like girls that have hands from playing piano too
maybe if it works out well
haha i was gonna say
actually you have to go first
haha and maybe if it works out super well...
well maybe its an extended ten minutes
we probably lose track of time :\
hmm idk
ahaha then from there you give up...we most likely start making out and I remind you why you love boys who have nice hands and fingers from playing piano...
and then the ten minute mark starts-
and your probably like fighting with your life to keep my hands away from the hem of your skirt* as always
so basically your lady friends are distracting me
this is the part where your like incredibly unbelievably turned on
shh were getting there
*they're distracting me
so i don't even know what the movie is
but your low cut shirt is distracting me
like watching a movie or something
so were maybe snuggling?
and
love you :)
anyway...
i guess with you its obvious
no shorts idk if that was obvious
yess hehe
because you obviously are trying to turn me on
and your wearing something provacative
mine haha
or yours?
hmm maybe at my house?
so were alone right?
haha then i shall
haha fine then shall I?
haha ok
just maybe?
will you tell me?
haha well if i tell you
haha at first i thought that was your answer :)
haha i asked first :)
well you still have to tell me :)
haha your right :)
only if you want there to be consequences :)
hehe what about ten minutes of inconsequential alone time with me
hmm
that i can give you
haha name something you want
hmm
hmm if you tell me then...
noo you have to
well you have to
dont even pretend to think about it hehe
same hormone level as firday afternoon?
haha like
yeah
what would you do haha?
the moment it was over
it would just be forgotten
with NO consequences like
ten minutes with me alone
ok if you had
may i ask a question lol?
question
okay
hmm
my mom was bein weird
haha nothing
im here
actually nvm
hey can i brb for like ten minutes?
awwWW
mmhmm :)
ur cutee
hehe
lolol
awww :)
[With carebear eyes] make me have to threaten to not wear cologne anymore?
do we have to do this again
really
haha its hawt when you wear the black skirt lol
haihai
ok hehe
nah doesnt work
5?
haha you don't under that one either do you hehe
what about the jean skirt one
haha jk
nothing?
and conversely you've gotten to the level of not wearing shorts under your skirts
but yeah
then looked it up again
wait is that right
i was like
actually
yeah i was gonna say that
:) common misconception
they're lagamorphs
you may know that Rabbits are not Rodents
ROFLCOPTER
i mean the whole bunny-skirt thing
yeah and this turns me on
this one does
all give you a clue it never wears shorts under its skirts...
yeah i guess
your really close
no
guess!
guess
guess whats even more adorable
haha wtfs wrong with you Desi
aw my corgi is like batting at her own nose
and these cute lil noises you make
ooh and cute lil lips and sooooft hands
and big beautiful round eyes
and butt haha
the cuttest lil nose
well you have
you don't have a choice love, sorry
just in contrast of your cuteness levels
and you make Desi look like a spider
and her stubby lil tail is like quivering out of joy
while trying to hold it in her two front paws straight upwards
shes nibbling on a nylabone
right now
the Corgi
TRUMP
COMPLETELY
and you TOTALLY
because of how cute my corgi is
people go insane
literally
and HE was trying to get her to sleep with him
Jason was cuddling with Desi last night
literally
hold on shh a sec
on a cuteness scale?
do you know hard it is to beat a corgi
i have a fucking corgi
and trust me
alternatively, you are possibly the cutest thing i have ever layed eyes upon
to continue
your irrestibly fun
i mean
and to tell the truth your pretty hard not to be madly in love with haha
is because you are one giant bundle of awesome
the only reason I love you
trust me
and she tries to make me jealous
you know what happens
because when natalie gets jealous
to not make her jealous
i do everything in my power
trust me
yeah cuz i get so fucking pissed when people try to make me jealous
and i purposely try to never bring you up in conversation
she said she gets really jealous of you
not on purpose
yeah :(
yeah haha
I know
only laughs when somethings funny
Mrs Donches
but like
yeah i guess
no but seriously he would laugh at everyone that wasn't funny just as much as the funny things
xD
ahahahah
like leigh
he laughs at things that arent funny
but like
like he is a really funny guy
LOL
ok im sure Mr Stephens wasn't sincere
her and Mr. Stephens do this thing where I'm one hundred percent sure they fake laugh
eh mrs burnett kinda irks me sometimes
ik hahaha
ahahaha i love her so much
wait one more time
I. Am. Going. To. Shoot. Myself.
haha that just made me think of Dr Kimmel going
omg
YES
you don't wanna know hahaa
shes a skank
nah its ok
yeah ik haha
eh
hehe
yepp
like go fuck yourself logan
Yeah...we have to hang out. Bring Jason...
this is what she said
literally
said
when she told me she was comin to PA a while ago
well Logan
oh yeah haha
what?
haha same
and then supposedly you coulda got emery when she liked him?
and then you liked chris when she coulda got chris
*guy
like you got me when she liked me
she gets a guy you like
you get a girl she likes
it always back and forth that
i remember natalie said
idk 8th?
didnt you like chris?
yeah
ik haha
haha she just whacked him with her lacrosse stick outta nowhere
like she hits him
yeah he gets soooooooooo pissed
omg shes so violent towards chris
whos always violent
but then you have fuckin liz
like with more femenine girls its nice because you get sorta that violent femininity
but with some its cute
like when some girls do it it pisses me off
you
obviously your never mean to him right up to his face
like it goes along with the girls encouraging violence
ik its weird but i kinda love it in a weird way
haha when your like kinda demeaning to sam
i wuv woo
hehehehehehe
Well atleast we all know who the Mafiette is
Sam's alive?!?!?!
haha WHAT?
best time of my life haha
mafia with Sam
and omg
he just was
and omg Sam Levin
on the plane ride he was funny
yeah hehe
yeah hes really funny
RJ is funny too haha
oh ok then yes shes very pretty
i figured it worked both ways
haha yeah i do but i hate it when you say some guy is really hot soooo
haha shes ok
shes so funny sometimes
ahahaha
*leone?
my last names leon!
I pronounce you Ashley the Valiant
haha
and god shes so dumb sometimes
but probably think less of him for it
and shell laugh
oh ashley are you ready to go to work at the strip club?
cuz he says stuff like
i feel bad for him
i roomed with him we were talkin till like 12
not that i know of
he really really likes ashley
like
but deep down he does really have feelings for people
and dont tell anyone this please
yeah he actually has really really low self esteem
they wont say it to his face
but like
but alternatively hes a bitch to Sam Levin so I admire that much of him
so he does it more
people are nice to him
and so he sees that when hes an ass
but deep down they hate him
so people sorta act nicely towards him
for being abusive
of getting attention
because hes trapped in a vicious little circle
*way
i feel really sorry for him in a wayt
ooo right
indifferent?
like him? hate him?
hey what do you think of arjun?
hehe me too
the number thing
i wonder what happened with that
LOL

i can just picture myself
^notice i said gay man

like borderline oedipus complex
it's actually freaky
and he has like a weird obsession with being with his parents so he can never hang out
i have one friend who has a remote sense of style
yeah i couldn't get anyone to go with :(

i'm not sure how i feel about that :/
i think i have a weak spot for asians
haha yeah maybe
like cmon alicia
like how is that not awkward for you?
yeah like i don't even think she tries to make an effort to not display what's up her skirt to every single person she sees
like crossing that boundary between super flirt and whore
a super super flirt
hmm she's like
but i do not want to think about that
yeah we sorta had a thing last year
7th grade
nah haha
haha my ex
oo btw do i look like a douche in my profile pic?
trust me
yeah i know haha
she's kinda weird anyway
it's fine though
yeah i know! haha
i think she just figured i wasn't worth it
so i think by the time it was over
so she assumes that i'm ditching her
and i'm always like "i really want to but i'm at a tournament all day today and tomorrow"
like "let's play xbox tonight!!"
she's ALWAYS
during wrestling season
here's what happened i think
haha she doesn't like me
it's all good though its definitely for the best
:D
haha i have no idea!
so umm yeah not much new hehe
and i kind of turn into a hermit over spring break
yeah i know i'm changing that

GOOD
i think Devil Inside will be worse
what a fucked up movieeee
"Look mommy I'm burning!"
omgg that scene in silent hill
you're so engaging kaylie
ahahahaha
damnit
*ROOM
haha go to my roo,
<3
alright i trust you haha
alright then i guess its all three of us haha
haha do you want to?
?
plan's still all three of us
so whats the deal with Devil Inside?
why are the nights in silent hill like 4 minutes long?
the square has "HELL" written in it
and at the end
runs over a hopscotch thing on the sidewalk
the main character
in silent hill
omg i never noticed
they are so cutee haha
haha see that's why i love cats
haha you're both gingers
i think itchy's cuter
yeah haha
hOlY sHiT that is a fat cat
haha i love cats
haha fatass kitty
holy shit thats a fat fucking kitty
ahahaha really?
dumbass cat
awww haha
aw good puppy
dude my dogs will kill cats :(
ahahahaha
woah they get along?
hahaha you'd be a great puppy
where as its pretty easy to understand what a dog is thinking
like the shit that goes on a cats head is a mystery to me
i like how complex they are
yeah haha i like cats
it wasnt my choice to have a bunch of doggies
yeah
that means she and i are compatible
damnnn
what about amanda?
hahahaha
yeah haha that's a very plausible counter-argment
so a cat person needs attention where as a dog person likes to give it?
haha you think they more embody their animals?
cuz the kitty person has all this attention to give and the dog person needs it all
a dog person and a cat person will always go well together
that the bottom line is
haha the guy said
while a doggy person is reversed
then recieve it
is more equipped to give attention
hahaha but usually a cat person
soooo if you're a dog person
it just always gives attention
and never demands attention
and is kind of happy with anything
that loves to hang with others
is a really really outgoing creature
a dog, however
and would rather ask for a attention then give attention
is that it demands attention from a human
but the thing about a kitty
that loves to mess with others
a cat's kind of a solitary creature
you have to look at it from the perspective of a cat
haha well if you're a cat person
hahaha i listened to a guy talk for twenty minutes about what it means if you're a dog vs a cat person
backkk
brb
that's interesting ;)
hmmmm
are you a cat person or a dog person?
haha that's cute
awww dude
haha i love cats
awww
haha i watched it with jason
best fucking movie
let's just go there by ourselves!
instead of going to a psycholgist or therapist

and says the name of this place
my little girl tries to committ suicide in her sleep
haha silent hill
haha for some reason when a girl smells really good it like reduces willpower
hahaha why do girls hair always smell good?

haha
hahaha brb
haha just read it
then i'll leave it a mystery
:)
ahaha
see if you can figure out why
.
.
.
.
.
.
My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun; Coral is far more red than her lips' red; If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun; If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head. I have seen roses damasked, red and white, But no such roses see I in her cheeks; And in some perfumes is there more delight Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks. I love to hear her speak, yet well I know That music hath a far more pleasing sound; I grant I never saw a goddess go; My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground. And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare As any she belied with false compare
it reminded me of our relationship
btw i was looking for this love poem
same thing basically
diff interpretations obviously
wow i'm a fag
and my hair is normally spiked up
i know that song on piano

it actually really bothers me
i hate how girls go for assholes
that's good
yeah that'd bother me
i mean i'm sure she's a nice person
im sure she's a nice girl but from past experience girls who wear too much makeup are trouble
the vibe
like when they wear too much makeup it intensifies
idk i just get a bad vibe from
some girls

i don't know one person that has said "i wish i tried harder in highschool"
20 years from now are going to wish they had more fun as a kid
all those people that are constantly worrying about their grades
you'll always have a lot of fun, have great friends, and be really happy
no matter what college you go to or what grades you get
kaylie no matter what you do
haha its fine
i feel like i'm going to reach a point where i have to ditch one
blah
aren't smart AND are bad at sports
and all the really musical people i know

the people i wrestle with
none of them are good at any sports
all the smart people i hang out with

nah jason might be a little whipped
aw haha
from you lol
yeah i heard about that
well it's not premeditated so it's not like you're a horrible person
sorry yeah it does but it's not that bad
LOL
idk why but it's so much fun to notice others' mistakes
i love grammar
i know haha
'they' refers to more than one person
"If someone is hungry, he or she should eat."
that would be correct
hahaha
*pronouns
but uhm it has to do with pronounds
typo win
sorry
LOL
*hint
ill give you a hit
<3
nope haha
"If somebody is hungry, they should eat."
name the error in the sentence
here's one
okay ready
yeahhh awk haha
not correcting you i was correcting myself
haha
no to mine
*notice
notices that chat abbreviation lingo ^^
haha except for you dont like asian ppl
i stole it from you
haha yeah i called my bro that yesterday
yeah see you did it ^^
i.e. heyy kaylie
for emphasis
and sometimes double up the last letter of a word
and i omit capitalization, punctuation, etc.
and theyre technically not words
like ill say lol or rofl
to be part of my texting/im vocabulary
hahaha i consinder lingo
and haha yeah okay i'm glad you see where im coming from
yeah i spell like perfectly when i text
see how much fun it is???
haha YES
but with jason i like nab him on every single one
like on 95% people i ignore grammatical mistakes
cuz i correct him all the time
lol and i do it to f' with jason
CMON THAT DOESNT EVEN MAKE SENSE
and you're like
but you know when someone has REALLY bad grammar?
but like that was a bad example
if i have offended you
augh i'm sorry
i know that makes me sound like a snob
and it bothers me so much when people say that
sorry
good is not an adverb
augh!!
"She ran really good"
but she says like
were probably more hic than her
nononon not at all
but like ahhh
so much
it's horrible that it bothers me
and gahhh one thing that bothers me about her is that she has really bad grammar
oh and this is the breeder who's dog ate my kitty
yeah
and i have this thing against rat terriers
they're also rat terrier puppies
haha yeah
her website btw
http://www.riverridgeratterriers.com/
she said it was changing newspaper for hours and hours and hours every day
she loves animals and she hated it
and had 22 puppies in her house
and dude this lady just had two litters like a month ago
he said it was awesome
and yeah my brother did it a while ago
sweet i just posted on her wall
but she has a fb
not like online
she's on fb i can do it right now
oh really? want me to ask her?
idk if that would gross you out
haha if you think that'd be cool lemme know i can put you two in touch
and she always asks for volunteers to help deliver litters
i have like a family friend that breeds dogs
wait dude
but i can see where u come from
not to me
well
oo that sounds really interesting
i only talked to her like once though
hmm i should ask her haha
but no dude i know a freshman girl that loves animals and does a TON of volunteer work
haaha
wheee
not at all
hmm so you love animals but hate bio
that's so awesomee
so you really like animals that much?
haha my uncle went to college for animal husbandry
ooh that's an interesting field
would you wanna be a psychiatrist or psychologist?
the age-old question
hmm
don't you want to be a doctor though?
ah
hmm is it science in general or just bio
what's your least fav subject
hmm
do you like history?
screw school
but whatever haha
it's really not
i get this vibe you think i'm sorta telling you this to be nice
nah you are
you're just as smart as me if not smarter i can tell
dude trust me i hang with a lot of smart people
but honestly
although admittedly it is pretty cool having a 4.25 GPA
it shouldn't really affect your life
like its a number
like i'm not happy with my grades

i'd trade it for ur social life hehe
and dude i hate it

nooo

that's just so horrible
ahh
yeah i know it doesn't help and it's never true
augh i'm sorry i want to say i know how you feel but that would be beyond stupid
i'm so so so so so so sorry
the fact that it would actually happen to you
it seems like it always happens to someone else
that's just
well i can see why you would hate god
honestly
that's beyond horrible
that's horrible
no human being in the world should have to go through that
i am so so sorry
oh my god
why?
and use it to take advantage of thousands of people
liek that
how someone could take an idea
it's just so horrible
the idea of hell on the other hand infuriates me
but it doesn't really affect me
the idea of heaven is nice
yeah it really is
do you?
not really
you got me on that one
yeah
ah i guess were sorta on the same page though
ahaha we don't go to mass or anything though
haha
yeahh who doesn't
and my mom's like a weird mix of quaker and apathetic agnostic
*atheist
my dad's an extremist athesit
neither do wee
yeah haha but you atleast you're part of a religion
actually i attended a korean church service once i don't think it counts though
nope never have been
three things in the world i don't know anything about
religion, TV, and sports
and i guess broadcast TV
yeahh
100% of the reason
literally
it's cuz i don't watch sports
people are always amazed at how i get the time to do a lot of the things i do
yeah still no bells
honestly i've never even heard of them
yeah you learn something new every day
haha
i didn't know the team name was the same as the college name
well obviously i know all those colleges
if you said some might recognize one
nopee
couldn't name a team, a player
about college basketball
i know nothing
honestly
haha
i could attest to my ignorance but you probably wouldn't believe my if i tried
no
how significant...
ahh
yeahhhh haha
100%
i don't even know who it was against
honestly
chyeah
i still would not have
with nothing to do
if i had been at home
no
i'm like that with sports
not really
now the simpsons

lmfao
LOL
and yeah it's pretty i guess
haha i'm not taking any chances at sounding retarded again...
okay good haha
in case that wasn't clear...
since corn=maize
and maizy makes me think of corn haha
jade is like beautiful/mysterious
sophie is really bubbly i think
delilah is pretty and sounds very innocent
the two most unnattractive females i know of are named lily
aughh not lily
i like angel
yesss

yeah that'd be kinda weird
i probably sound pretty fucked up...
and that came up i'm like SHIT
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Dahlia

and i was like
and there was an extra long reply
cuz i said it
yeah i didn't know it was something else
the songgg
the song

yeahh same that's part of the attraction
i like Dahlia more though
that's a dreamy name haha
they were shitting everywhere i hear
all puppies
and a week ago she had like twenty two dogs in her apartment
well she's a dog breeder
she named a litter after like all the people from that old TV show called the munsters

yeahhhh ahaha
ahaha the dog who-who has like 13 nipples
yeah and his daughter is one of my dogs
and he ate my cat ):

rawr
and guys think smart girls are demasculinizing
haha they like to feel more powerful?
yeahhh
ahahaha yeah me too
well atleast you're not pretending

i guess it is real but it seems to me most people are more attracted to the idea of it rather than the actual msuic
literally it's so eassy

but not weird :)
un-traditional i think
it's not weird
like the friendly part or the physical part or the lovey-dovey part?
which part of it?
?
what makes her think so
that's undoubtably not good
really?
it seems easy to keep one just hard to get one
i think it's not that bad once you get one
just like
i doo
dang that's a while
ohh
oh
mackenzie and paul?
oh really?
i mean i thought they were going out
yeahh
sorry i'm bad when i indirectly reference someone -.-
yeaaa
i don't see how people can do something like thatt
yeahh :/
yeahh people see what they want to :/
on this whole matter?
whats her opinion?
hmm
hmm
but continue
that says something
whattt?
until there's no hot water left
i like can't get out
yeahh who doesn't haha
haha that wakes you up? usually people take cold showers to wake up i think
haha if you wake up at 11:00 it's not hard at all...
i think it's easier to shower if you wake up late
haha really?
yeah i'm a shower at night person
yeah me too but i live an hour from my school so i sleep on the way to school
they're so cold and miserable and dark
i just hate mornings
actually i'm more of a night person

i don't get how you could do something like that
people are just normally good people

but for the longest time
yeah i agree with that
i generally try to convince myself that humans are like good by nature and it's things like that that make me doubt myself
well
it's still sad
thanks cuz i'd feel horrible
okayy
*whatsoever
whatsover?
like my existance did not alter the outcome of this situation?
idk i have nothing to do with this right?
yeah but now i feel bad

like he's fine in small doses
but for some reason he kinda annoys me a little bit
haha forget i said anything
noo not at all
maybe i'm wrong but i thought he was
yeah dude i thought he was holding hands with a girl
crazy little mofo?
hyperactive as hell?
yeah i've met him a few times
wtf who was he holding hands with?
do you like him much?
ooh hhaha yeah he was there with his gf
but i guess you know him?
ahahah
haha nah its cool but he was there

haha idk how to spell his last name
?
Paul Crotchiello or something
hey do you know like

oooh no it wasn't olivia's bf
if that helps lol?
he doesn't like his girlfriend?
yeah not fat though
junior who plays hockey

cuz like jason went off with his posse and like literally ditched me
do you know Olivia Mcewen?
i had so much fun!
they're undefeated though apparently
by abington
yeah i guess not
yeah like 38 to 17 or something like that
hey soudy got killed last night in football
i'm sorry
:(
any fun classes?
how's school goin for you??
yesss that's horrible
i'm nervous for PSAT's i don't need all that stress
SAT's
yeah me neither :(
i hear junior years hard as hell though
so far it's pretty easy
kinda weird being a sophomore
better than freshman year definitely
i guess it's going pretty well
nooope
so i take that back
although being close to glass in a hurricane is a horrible idea
or like in a hurricane
yess it will haha
it'll be like actually being in the middle of ittt
i'm just waiting for like a blizzard
it gets annoying though
yeah
there are almost no artificial lights
a lot of the rooms have two walls of just glass
yeah but omg our school is amazing
our school was just rebuilt hopefully shit doesn't come spewing out of our fountains (:
lmao
i hope that doesn't happen to our school
0.0
yeah that's nasty
that's soo nasty lololol
LOL
you guys were evacuated or something?
yo what happened at your school with a sewage leak or something??
aww that sucks
and being an a group of people i don't know doesn't help
i'm kinda introverted so i'm not really much of a party person
hahaha i hopee
other than jason
and i won't be talking to anyone eitherr
haha i've heard of red alert
but that woulda been mad awks
sorry that was dick
gooood haha

it'll probs be awk cuz i don't know that many people but w/e
yeahh jason asked me to come
at soudy
heyy i think i might be seeing your football game tomorrow
i'm sure it works with sports too
like guys love girls that play videogames haha
in some ways guys like sorta un-girly traits
idk
girly girls get annoying really fast
oh c'mon i think most guys would rather watch sports with their girlfriend then go out to dinner
i think a lot of guys would find that desirable
yeah but in a good way
haha i think a lot of guys would prefer that too
really??
haha somehow i doubt THAT
that's a nice attitude towards it i guess
really? that's kind of unusual i guess
depends on the park i guess
well
haha you know if a guy asked you out in a park you'd probably go crazy too
but nah its cute
haha i guess
yeah haha he really likes her
lol okay bud
"it was beautiful"
yeah haha

idk im prejudiced because my bro girls out with girls my age and hes just starting college

so probably senior
it was like the day college started
she probably wasn't college
aggrevates me

yesss it was
hahaha that's good
i just thought about it
HAHA THATS GROSS
LOL xD
i think i'm kinda weighted because my aunt was smashing on it
hahaha i think the CGI and the action part was good :)
i think there were a few fundamental plotholes and i think the romantic subplot was kind of skipped over
haha not really

yeah i saw it with my aunt actually in NY
yeah haha me too
i hope it starts lightening out
hahaha yeah
yeah the last one was "Ka-" too

that's pretty cool
thats actually pretty cool
oh damn you like talk to him
never used twitter before

oh yeah you told me about that haha
that's good lol
haha not really
good show
i used to watch way too much star trek when i was little
of course my brother is watching star trek right now
woo haha
hahaha maybe you have a bit of nerd in you
you watched the show haha!?
there was a giant flying duck billed platapus in the movie
yeah
like legit it was soooo horrible
in my whole life
worst movie i've ever seen
i watched the last airbender today
idk i was wondering if you saw it cuz im watching the sequel i didnt know there was one
yeah :(
so the gunpowder pushed out and when the actor fired the gun it killed the actor
and there was already a bullet in the barrel
and they fired at him
so gunpowder with no bullet
and put in a black
they took out all the bullets
and then later
like into the barrel
it pushed the bullet into the gun
so when they fired it off
but they forgot to take out the primer
but take the gunpowder out
someone decided to use real bullets
when they were getting the prop gun
yeah
and they accidently shot him
like they were shooting a scene
yeah
was killed in the making of the movie
played by Brandon Lee (Bruce Lee's son)
but the lead character -
pretty good movie
and he sorta comes back from the dead for revenge
basically this guy and his gf get murdered
the movie
have you ever seen The Crow?
yeah i'm not bad i guess
oh crap i said it backwards the second time 11 wins 7 losses
so in highschool its like 10x more competitive
then in high school 7 wins 11 loss
my record was 27 wins 3 losses
in middle school
well
haha wrestling season helped a lot with that
idk
well i mean i guess i do
yeah see i don't really have as high a pain tolerance as i would like haha
yeah see that would suck
it sounds excruciatingly painful
NOPE
?
ever been hit by a rock
hmm
so it stings like anything
like when you punch but you make it so that all the force goes into one nuckle
like a really strong dude
by a dude
ever been like knuckle punched?
it's soo much fun
it's painful as anything
good life decision
losing is like a week of intense pain...
cuz it's not like losing is humiliation
the only game i'd ever take seriously is paintball
hahaha yeah i know right
haha in a weird way i sorta like seeing people get exasperated over it and caring so much
i like fitness testing
i've never really liked running
haha idk i don't like jogging
i like climbing the ropes too
ahahahaha
samee!
diving board is easy though
hahaha yeah me too
never tried it on a hard surface though
i can do one on padding
oh damn thats pretty good
from the side or a diving board?
no haha its cool i teased myself too
like ever seen a really tall person do a backflip?
the only good thing about being short is you're kinda agile
i got teased a lot
yesss like a hobbit
i used to be freakishly short
oooh nice i'd rather be taller
yeah i'd rather be taller too
haha would you rather be taller?
oh dang
i'm like 5'6
haha i'm pretty much there
haha i'm short
oh damn
how tall are you?
ooh okay that's good
like god some of the swimmers at my school
kinda scares me away haha
where if a girl can beat me up
idk i have this thing
haha i guess that's good
0.0
haha i didn't wanna sound like a judgemental ass so i normally wouldn't say that haha
that's not really muscular that's like bulky
just when some girls get like jacked their legs get like massive kinda odd
haha i guess it's not muscular
actually nvm
that could be a mixed blessing
i guess that's good haha?
haha dang
oh damn i guess you were in pretty good shape?
oh damn :0
but oww i'm so sorry
Tibia haha?
what happened?!
why'd you stop?
haha see that would kill me
oh
aww you're talented but let's be honest would you want to spend four hours a day in a gym?
that's certainly good btw
she's now number one nationally
his sister's in a gymnastics competition
Jason's in california btw
haha
good to know you're not a creeper
that's mildly creepy haha
I have no clue
but yeah that sounds fun
oh okay
that's sorta what i visualized
ooooh not like the type where you can go and get a pet mouse or gerbil or snake or something?
ooh then good choice. But alternatively there's probably a lot of animals that die there :/
you like animals?
oooh that sounds fun
haha my bro works in the food court at the limerick plazas
haha i'm so busy during the year i've like never got time
i've never really thought about working during the year
oh then you're fine i guess
well i've never really applied so i wouldn't know i guess
isn't a bit late in the summer for that?
but aside from that very relaxing
i was on vacation and at two different camps
honestly i've been gone most of it
haha sounds very relaxing
what have you been up to?
haha yeah it was fun

sorry im pretty clueless when it comes to colleges
ooh really?
where are you thinking about going to college?
haha yeah.
believe it or not lol
also soudys a really good highschool
but dude volunteering at a hospital like totally outweighs the GPA thing
haha totally with you there
haha GPA's don't really matter much anymore
3.94
and with an A- being a 3.7 its a
unweighted its a 4 btw
np
if you count an A- as a 3.7 and unweight it its much lower
haha thats a few ifs though
haha a 4.6 ....
so basically the soudy system
which is weighted
and you count honors as +1
an A- is a 4
if you assume
well
we dont like get them on a report card
i actually just calculated mine for the first time
hahaha nice
do you count an A- as a four or 3.7?
haha xD
is that weighted or unweighted?
yeah you should be fine then
you might need a 3.0 gpa too though idk
yeah haha
or 15 maybe
12 hours of community service or something?
dont yoiu only need like
really why not?
so i guess your in the national honors society or w/e it is that jason talks about?
haha thats pretty cool
dangg
damn how is that possible lol
but anyway.
i realize ridiculous wasnt the best word choice
like crazy not stupid
thats pretty ridiculous
woww
or so far?
per year?
oh damn
also good oppurtunity to get community service hours in
hmm sounds fun
well my moms always on my ass about getting a good internship or a hospital to volunteer at or something

wait do you do it over the schoolyear?
meh but i wont be able to start till next summer
ooh okay when i get back to the states ill prob do that

hmm strange haha
yess id agree and you have freckles
haha you dont embrace your ginger side?

canadians are french
although
haha yeah

you like scottish
haha what are you?
its 2000 costa rican dollars here for like a five dollar meal

so the dogs can just come and go
just kinda pillars
have no walls
cuz all the restaurants here
cuz of the tourists
fat
get like
but the dogs here
you know normally i would think that too
and hang out with you
a dog will come up to you
im 100 percent sure
if you just sit down on the street
you have to come here
if your a dog person
it was soooo cute
and it finally left to go hang out in some restaurant
then followed my brother and dad into town
and followed my friend to breakfast
and the next day we got up nd it was there
then waited overnight
then waited outside the hotel for us
all the way back to the hotel
the dog followed us again
and when i left with my bud megan

then we ate dinner
with my family
followed me all the way into town

can you see that?
https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2209955864729&set=p.2209955864729&type=1&theater

lmaoz
roflz
lolz
i used to put "z" on the end of everything
haha i'm branching out
no words ;)
shhhh
yeah the whole on-off drugs and the whole searing pain in the facial region
so i don't blame you at all
and besides you have an excuse to be in a bad mood
yes haha i would agree
kaylie kaylie kaylie i promise you i'm not mad
kaylie i'm not mad at you!
nooo
no! haha
no haha i can't dislike people
i love you <3
no it's fine
it's fine i was kind of a dick too
ugh let's just move past this
stopp
no it's fine haha
but can you atleast see why it's so bad?
i know yours was 10000x more horrible
alright I'm sorry but i mean
so you should know that you can't just "change" because someone else wants you to
because of something that happened to you
while you hate it
i like commitment and that shit
and i mean
you can't just expect me to change instantly
that is something you're good at
i'm really really bad about meeting new people
listen alright
so your reaction is to act mean about it?
like i would totally understand if you didn't want to do something like this
unsensitive?
idk
god you're so like
whatever
you're being like, unbelievably mean
damn kaylie
haha alright i asked my friend but whatever
:/ I'm sorry
alright i can tell you don't really want to talk to me
haha see now the fact that you're angry is making isn't helping
:/
ahhh you're pissed at me
?
what if i bring a friend
okay
well i mean she should...
alone*
see you don't want to be a lone either
ugh
aghhh why can't just you and I hang out
fine then what's my real reason?
so it ended up making it 2000x times worse
and look how that turned out
i agreed to it
and so to try to get over it
and I mean i was like really shy before the whole amanda thing
:( but you're better with meeting new people
like from meeting new people
i said you've never had any like that
kaylie i never said you've never had any traumatic experiences
have you ever had a traumatic experience meeting new people...
in that area
because you're really outgoing and have never had a traumatic experience
and like i try to not be!
well in positions like that I usually am...
and i'm saying I don't want to ditch you guys
how she ditched me
like
i mean I don't want to be like panda
:(
it's a mental block thing
and ditch me!
i'm not saying you're not going to show up!
i know!
dude last time when panda ditched me it like fucked me up forever about this kinda stuff
haha
and your house
three
that all know each other
2350293759023 people you don't know
meating
awkward
freaking
because it's super
or just hung out by ourselves
this is why i wish we'd like videochatted or something first
and get a ride from my dad?
would you want to go and hang out with one of my friends by yourself?
alright at least try to see it from my perspective?
idk
the weirder it is for me
the more people i don't know
that like
yeah but like tht thing is
and her mom
without introducing 12235092385920 people
first
hang out
me and you
grr why can't we
agh i want to go but i don't want to meet all these people at the same time
i know!
definitely the most awkward
it was one of the worst days of my life
and, the last time I did this
haha do you know why i'm weird and shy about this
how?
what!!
oh
going to your house
her mom
you
panda
but like
that's not that bad
and i mean meeting just like you
idk meeting people i've like never met face to face is kinda freaky
haha
kaylie this whole idea is freaking me out now

Real Time
kaylie there's a movie you really need to see!!
aww why tanks kaylie
haha for a dumb person like me
"It doesn't! They're completely the same!"
and the answer, on the next page, is
"How does this element differ from this one?"
and it has like this question at the bottom
to learn this computer thingy
i'm using this book
alright i thought this was really funny

kayliee <3
:( i'm just in a bad mood too i'm probably acting like a dick
i feel like a dick too though
aw kaylie i'm sorry
ugh kaylie i don't want you to leave on a bad note
i meant i didn't want you to hurt someone
i didn't mean it like that
i really really just don't want you to hurt someone else really badly
kaylie i don't think you're a bitch
waiiiiit
:(
i'm sorry
aghhhhh
because you haven't confronted him
he thinks you still like him
joe
take like
i know but
because if you hated me i'd never know!
the fact that you don't like confronting people scares me a little bit
you said you were ignoring him
then not know why i lost a friend
i'd rather be rejected
because you're just ignoring him
well you're being ten times worse by doing nothing!
well tell him
you would feel horrible
and you had no idea why
how would you feel if one of your best friends just stopped talking to you
so what he fucked up?
wow
because you don't like confrontations?
?
so you're just going to lose a friend over it>
kaylie you seriously just can't ignore that
well just tell him that
atleast then you'll still be friends
just tell him you appreciate it but you don't feel the same way
your friend
meh
agh i'm gonna go
maurghhh
no it's fine
i sound like a dick
i'm sorry
kaylie that's like the worst possible thing you could do
>:(
that's horrible
ahh that's bad
aww <3
haha i'd imagine not?
haha am i your best guy friend?
haha SUBJECT CHANGE
don't worry love it's you <3
haha
who do you think?
whatsup
she's probably my second best girl friend now though
:(
that was a long time ago too
and i was way too self aware to date an ugly girl
but people were being really judgemental
and we did almost have a thing a while ago
but she's really ugly
actually i can think of one
and actually i can't think of any off the top of my head
very few in my grade though
there are some nice ones
:)
ahahahaha
haha are there any girls you approve of me going out with?
haha you're overanalyzing it kaylie
she made this vid on youtube of just a bunch of clips put together and advertised on it and made like 200 bucks in a week of doing nothing
haha kelsey's smart as shit
that too
oh
kelsey just calls other people out on being stupid haha
leanna pretends to be really stupid
haha i promise you they're so different
they're so different though
yeaaaah haha
kinda like leanna
hahaha i can sort of see a little bit of the clueless dumb blonde look
95% of the time she's a gem
but the problem is i only ever tell you about the bad things she does
haha i'm not her biggest fan all the time
haha <3
haha :D you don't like kelsey
do you think i'm going to be rejected or something like that?
haha you just dissaprove of it
yesss you are!
are you saying i should just hook up with her?
haha
not really
what?
yeah like six months ago
JESUS KAYLIE
I'M NOT ASKING HER OUT
sorry that came out wrong
nooo as in blaming me for being superficial
whaaaaaat how is that bad
so don't go all superficial on my ass haha
she didn't want to
you know i asked her out a while back right?
what?
but i doubt she will
if she wants to go out then i'll go out with her
no!
i'm not saying i'm asking her out
haha
she just gets weird sometimes
she's never intentionally mean
nah
now that i think about it
like this has got to stop
i'm inviting kelsey to something tomorrow
that was a YEAR AGO
holy shit
ish
haha one of the two girls that hated me
i told you i'm just hitting my innocent phase
yeah
holy shit it has been a while
i think the last time i kissed a girl was actually the same day i met you
haha alright whatev
it sounds really bad
it sounded better in my head
actually haha
want to know something really weird?
and then you messaged me that one time and i was like omg this girl is speacial haha
i just thought you were cool but we'd like never talk again
tragically so
haha when we met
haha our relationship has come so far
poor kaylie haha
the crazy wild one
haha it's a good look
haha
she's still beautiful!
IDC KAYLIE
haha you are <3
haha idc lemme see!
haha
yay
you're speacial
alright haha
okay love
we're stalkers
haha it's really bad kaylie
like it's bad
haha i've gotten really really good at stalking people
haha i do that all the time
oh weird
it's cool i don't need friends
haha it's okay
haha our conversation died a horrible death
it isss
it's such a good movie haha
and he's like not sure if he wants to go through with it
but then his stepsister bets the main character to sleep with this girl who's like the posterchild of innocence
*stuff
and stuf
they'll sleep with the person's daughter or whatever and then go and post pictures of them online
like when somebody does something bad to them
and they're kind of evil
like they're both really good at seducing people
who bet each other to sleep with people
haha this guy and his stepsister
ahh i think my second favorite movie
have you seen cruel intentions?
exactly haha i think it's kind of weird actually
(with a dude)
see there is no amount of alcohol you could give me to do that
hahaha ahhhh
ahh i want a bi girlfriend
haha wow
or when they're not but like trying to get a guy horny
yahh
but still
like i realize it's not a normal thing
i think it's so weird that girls can like be straight but kiss other girls
oh sweet
that's better than straight
oh
haha
but she's a lesbian
haha there are the lucky ones
d'aww
even though she's fake
i love her hair
and arianna grande is amazingly hot
i think you tried to show me a picture of her
yesss haha you did
i brought up the girl named India
i think so?
yeah haha
and i just love that name
Cave Johnson
that's fucking hilarious
haha there's this character in a game called cave
haha i think the name "cave" is cool for a guy
like "lake"
you want a more unique name
ohh yeah we went over this
your name gets better the more you say it
haha kayliekayliekaylie
and just cringed haha
breast-feeding vampire
and saw
i read that left to right
i feed off of your happiness
i'm glad <3
ahaha that bitch
that's me :D
hehe
say it like a whore
idk
sexy
almost sounds
hahaha
haha when does your damn face heal
ahh i love you <3
awww haha somehow that actually cleared up my bad mood
yes!
you know you'd be powerless
if he came on to you
i mean be honest
they so are
ahh subject change
they're all shallow hon
hence my reasoning for girls being superficial too
it just bothers me that he could literally steal any girl in the world from me
i really just need to take my mind off it
ah you're right
:/
mehh
oo haha
don't have issues?
i have serious issues with that shit
eh you're probably right i'm just horribly paranoid and assholish
yep
eh
including phonesex girl
he's inadvertently and unknowingly ruined pretty much every relationship i've had with a girl
i'm sorry i get weird when the conversation goes to jason
trust me he doesn't
haha
to me
he said me, you, and he should all hang out
he dislikes panda not you
once
no he doesn't he suggested we all hang out
i'm not haha
awk
haha alright
meh
you do
haha i'm serious
you have a serious crush on jason bro
haha i have revenge planned
me and jason <3
hahaha
and don't ask why i had glasses on
https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=416480688368444&set=t.1722475997&type=3&theater

haha i don't know enough about the situation <3
i'm like an uncracked egg
it's baaaad haha
haha i am really innocent
i didn't hit my innocence phase till ninth
haha it's so true
haha i was a slut in middle school
I KNOW RIGHT :D
SO DON'T JUDGE ME
WHICH WAS IN LIKE SEVENTH GRADE
haha she doesn't know about the phonesex
that's partially why she hates me
and one thing kinda led to another
haha she had this cousin
anyway
and yeah i think you're right
don't say it...
shit that's a hard one
let me think about that
hmm
so i assume so
we hugged on the last day
the other and i are on pretty okay standards
haha just one right now
hahaha you know that girl that hates me?
brb
haha
uhhh
have you ever had phonesex haha?
haha very awkward topic
aww haha that's so nice
no sarcasm intended
i'm actually seriously honored
haha i'm glad hanging out with me is better than textsex
you are a piece of gold kaylie
haha <3
i mean i'd pull all nighters with you
seems like the obvious dillema
haha
why are we hanging at 11:06 at night btw?
haha no prob
haha okay :D
that's definitely my weirdest title for you
hahaha aww my wiw hedgehog
adorable until prodded with a sharp stick
you're like a hedgehog :(
people take advantage of us nice people
ahhgh i know the feeling haha i'm the same way

which i assume are mostly negative
all of them

people who he's never met
he's the sort of person that jumps in people's conversations
but soon you'd think he's a dick
you really would
you would like him at first
nope
but when it's you it's funny and adorable
it's weird and gross
and when it's him
my brother is like that 2/3 of the time

awkward
more
like...i can't think of anything

or else that'd be super awkward...
that was supposed to go to me right...?
haha i can do that either way
so i'd just be sitting in a lobby for an hour
well she has to do like conference calls
definitely not
no
is it worth it spending three hours tagging along with my mom doing chores just to get a haircut...?
also
i'm ruthless
i know i know
choice A you might have to do 5 times but choice B you only have to do once
then i mean you're not really making a statement
and if you do something he wants to do
B, do something he doesn't want to
or
A, do something you don't want to do
you can either
i mean
sometimes you don't really have a choice
soo?
sorry, but you definitely shouldn't not reject a guy because you don't want to be mean
haha that's bad
he still wants to hookup
about what?
sounds bad...
haha
oh
haha is there actually a plot?
should i?
haha nope
mm how was it?
although nobody has been home in my family for like the last week so i can't really do shit

I greatly appreciate the contributions you make to our friendship

if i went outside it'd be awesome
tiny house + shitton of land
haha the only good thing about my house is all the land
grrr my old house was like 10000000000 times prettier
i wish i had a second story to my house
me too :(
you can close the blinds with a button :(
and a huge backyard
and there's a freaking huge living room, kitchen, and he has an INGROUND POOL
theres this huge banistered staircase that takes you to the second floor which like overlooks the first
the ceilings probably 60 feet high

a meth-dealing scorpion
like a scorpion
you are the worst kind of person
when you get on
kaylie way to not tell me
okay cya bud < 3
smartest kid at my school by far
fuckin genius haha
always right
3 seconds or less every time
and he instantly multiplies them
like 69 and 84
where you take two two digit numbers
i have a friend
haha math is my best and fav subject
sorry mah bad 9*81= 810-81
this is how i did it: 27*27 = 9*18 = 180-18
haha noooo
took me like legit a min and a half though
haha in math class i multipled 27 by 27 in my head i was super proud
alright so just nerd moment here
how's that
< 3
probably
but you missed it
that was a heart
<3
you go write that paper
haha good girl
hey i'm gonna go shower
hehe
i'm not sure why that was so funny
i just cracked up haha
ahaha AWWWW
haha awww
i used "at first" like 3 times in close proximity its bothering me
please get to know me first <3 i'm kinda shy in person at first
i'm probably going to be really awkward at first
when we hangout for our first time
by the way
good response
i love you the way you are
haha
oh you're plenty interesting
nah
it's a really really good thing
that is so perfect
ahahaha
when i was going with all the hearts?
didn't i say this was an issue before?
:)
can you see those
<3
YEAH
THAT'S HAPPENING TO ME
i wish i could visit btw
my group of friends from camp have our own facebook page
and i get along so well with people
but like i go to summer camps
because i mean obviously i'm doing something wrong
"i" was broken
just like
you know i used to think
meh they really are
haha they so do
they're just superficial
the guys aren't too bad
it's probably easier being a girl
i hate mine here
yeah it's just the girls
he's really gossipy
*a girl
besides this one guy who like is basically agirl
they can be dicks but i don't have grudges with them
and i'm like fine with all the dudes in my grade really
ugh i guess
and i have to talk to them
are in my classes
all the people that hate me
but in like private school
haha give them alone time
but like WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO
maybe i'm a little annoying? like if someone's pissed at me but won't tell me why i kinda drill them to get them to tell me
that is a great point
i mean i can't see that i'm doing anything wrong
haha
i have no idea
i'm kinda the douchebag that everyone hates
we would get along reallllllly well haha
haha people hook up in the woods
the only upside
it's soooooo beautiful
haha
and a swamp
and a creek
like a whole forest on campus with a marshland
btw did i tell you before that we have a nature preserve?
i know haha
i just wanna knock the shit out of him haha
gah i hate that
and this one kid i really don't like was whispering to a bunch of people
like my friend came up and told me that they were like drilling her for info after i left
and everyone was already pulling shit
and went through our arts center and stuff
like we went out and took a walk at our nature preserve
after school
i was just WALKING around school with this girl
i so so so am
like it would kill my parents if i left
ugh i'm too far invested in private school education :(
so idk if it woulda been a step up
it's even more uptight than GA
and i mean it's still a private school
and its a boarding school...
well they have to wear shirts and ties
to Hill School
i do :/ they tried to get me to move schools
now i'm introverted and shy as fuck
i was soooo outgoing before i went here
haha GA's the reason i'm so shy
but then again so am i
he's like hated by all the girls at our school
Ramzi Lodge
haha
he left
haha one kid did that
because he would fit in with the super selective posse
but like now, he would do fine
probably not by soudy standards
like he was the weird kid of the grade
he was also very strange before he left
completely seriously
jason and i were the two most unpopular people in our grade before he left
are vicious slugs
omg they so are
ugh it's how i feel
they're like the worst sort of people
the people that go to my school are horrible horrible people :(
yeah but at GA i would be ruined for that shit
i would kill to be able to do that
noooo i'm serious
doesn't work at GA though :(
haha i love your mentality
dude my asian fetish is a real curse sometimes
telling me how he wouldn't because he cares about his rep too much
my one friend is like
eh i might just totally go for it
kindaaa hot
haha this girl is majorr flirtatious
mrowr
i'm extremely pickly
i read that as
haha you are so selective
like cmon
is that girl not pretty though?
being a good texter bumps them up to a 4 or 5
if i think a girl's like a 2
ahhh she's a good texter
i may or may not have a thing for asian girls btw
hahaha i probably just show you 100000 of the same ones
that's the girl btw

"she's pretty but not someone I'd really want to date"
and i think i said like
like pretty or whatever
asked me what i thought of this other girl
mah 12 year old

...
groping me where...
ahhhhhh weird that you'd picture that
yea
and the other tried to grind with me
one told me i was turning him on
haha wasn't really assault
both at camp
i was assaulted by two gays on different occasions
nah the one you heard was a diff camp
and chased by a crowd of girls that were way too hot for me?
and was assaulted by a gay
did i tell you i went to acting camp for three weeks?
she's friends with the girl that got that fucking hummer
besides like the soudy people i'm friends with
because all our mutual friends are people that are very big into acting
?
is she really into acting
and i saw they were mutual friends
then i clicked
i wonder if

and i'm like
on my newsfeed i just saw my friend post something on her wall
woah
or sis or whatever
is "Suzanne Rainear" Emma's mom?

http://a5.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/240720_1337382330936_1722475997_572862_5257460_o.jpg
look at my house
anyway
but that's something that you can never return to me
i want my virginity back
ahahaha
what?!?!
:D
kill her
kill her
haha we are pretty freaky
from eating too quickly
we enjoy the pain that comes after it
that's the point
i know
he got me on the entrees though
i beat him on the desserts
yeah
racing
because we were uhm
haha when we were eating nothing
hehe
anyway yeah i haven't like legit drank milk since i was like eight
idk
giggity?
if i drink two glasses of milk i feel like shit and get sick
hahaha like you have no idea how bad that is
like i should be dead
how am i still alive right now...
and i'm lactose intolerant
then three cheesecake shooters
garlic bread
i had a plate of four cheese penne pasta
shared a place of potato curls with jalapeno sauce
dudeee applebees with jason
backk
and brb i'm having my fourth dessert of the night
haha i've only grinded once
haha kaylie's queen of grinding
alright didn't know if that like came across correctly
idk if this is obvious but in the announcement they were referencing grinding haha...
like nobody wanted to tell her
haha it was super awkward
"It's good that they made that announcement, I mean you shouldn't spend prom on the other side of the room from your date, talking to your friends"
and that day in Spanish she's like
"So prom went well, and I'm glad that the dates finally faced their partners for the last dance atleast..."
after prom there was an announcement
like
she's soooo conservative
i know right?
like dumbfounded
good way
all the girls in the class were like just staring at her
isn't it haha!
which was 48 years ago
and they got married the next year
and bam, right there he proposed
"Will you marry me?"
and she's like "ok what is it"
"Alicia, I have a question for you"
and then he said
and they talked for a while
and so she did
and went home to pick up this call from Francisco
school*
and ditched shcool
and so Alicia told all her teachers that she was having a family emergency
and it's her sister, saying that Francisco called her, from the US, and was going to call back in two hours
she gets a message at school that there is an "urgent call for her"
and then a few weeks later
and Alicia got really excited, so she wrote stole his address and wrote him this formal letter congratulating him on his degree and such
and then her friend in admissions, who knew about Francisco, saw his name come up in a letter to the college that Alicia was attending
so anyway a few years go by
who's name is "Francisco"
but she can't date anyone because she keeps thinking about the guy
and while she's going to college, she tries to meet people
and she thinks she'll never see him again
and then he leaves Mexico for college
so for a few years they flirt on and off
even though he was five years older
and she wouldn't go out with him because she said that he was "too young for her"
going to parties and things
and then for a few years they talk to each other
so they meet
and forces them to introduce him to her
goes and starts talking to her friends
so this dude
she ignored him
because since she was so conservative
or tried to
come's up to her and starts hitting on her
who's five years older than her
so this guy behind her
and so on
and "Alicia" is "Alithia"
so "Como estas" is really "Como ethta"
and in Mexico, you don't pronounce the "s" vowel when you speak
and she's talking
and she's a little younger than us right now at the time
is talking to her friends
and my teacher, Alicia
so her parents were hanging out in the movie theater
and they said alright as long as they went too
she asks her parents for permission to go to the movie theater with friends
so anyway
and she came from a really really conservative family
so like middle school/highschool
she's raised there but moves to mexico for her secondary schooling
is born in spain
this woman, Alicia
so backstory first
alright
are you ready for this
this is the most romantic story i've ever heard in my life
hold on
omg
it was so cute
she told me how she met her husband
ready
omg
*
lmao
lma
which means "what do you think I long for?"
"Que crees tu que yo anoro?
a question is
on a worksheet my spanish teacher made for me
alright this is really weird
yeah but you have to prioritize me because i will know nobody
...?
is she coming
o.0
we've never hung out
oh wait
i miss her
sameee
haha he is sexy
*
adamant
but he's adament on going to penn state
or like drexel or maybe even penn
like brown or lehigh
and he could definitely get into a good college
he can definitely apply to
any college i apply to
what's weird is
lol he's been working on it like 4x longer and he's using it to apply for a scholarship
jasons piece was way better
i know right
but it wasn't too bad
well they probably did
oh i messed up horribly but i doubt anyone noticed
wow you're on a quite a male homosexuality streak today aren't you
listening to dubstep with the windows down and the volume to the max
like we're so obnoxious haha
it was so bamf
he drove me like the whole time and we listened to dubstep the whole time
then to my house
then going out to applebees

three hour piano recital

let'ss see what she says
sophomore boy*
"but anyway, you seem like a REALLY nice, really cool, and really pretty. Like I would love to know you better, but the thing is I'd be the only Sophomore going, and I don't really know any juniors. If I had a lot of friends going or I knew you super well it would probably be different... I'm really sorry but I don't think it would be a good idea to go. Plus I'm like super super awkward at parties where I don't know anybody. This is like totally not an issue with you it's an issue with me..."
alright this is my speech
aww ron weasley
ginjas
haha <3
hehe
i know a lot of guys that don't have it yet

does that count haha?
i say hi to her in the hallways
i mean
and i've never talked to her in my life
but i know other people would be snickering
WHICH DOESN'T BOTHER ME PERSONALLY
first off she's kinda agreed to be the least attractive girl at my school
hold on
welll
yeah i'm sayin no thoughh
a girll asked me to prom
kaywiee
go to bed hon <3
yeah he is
haha i feel like i'm undermining him
eh well
really?
it's just weird feeling so left out haha
lmao it's alright
and a few girls came over and were like stuttering 0.0
i brought him to my school one time
haha i feel kind of left out
haha i just stopped hanging out with him around people our age
haha i feel the same way about jason
but you knoww
and if a guy is really whack enough to pass up a really cute redhead for a brunette just because she's a little more...idk i don't wanna say touchy
guys that chase a girl just for her looks are going to end up dissapointed
well i mean
what is?
which usually stems from an insecurity issue
oh no i was just gonna say it seems like she tries really hard
oh wow yeah she is really cute
it seems
she tries really really hard though
you guys are like the same <3 chillax hon
i think you overestimate Emma's looks
alright what haha
FYI
i think of you as more of a cat person
hopefully not people that forget that you have a dog?
i actually forgot you had a dog for a sec
haha aw
why?
750 calories instead of 1000 lmao
haha i'll do the "for less calories" method
haha alright fuck it mac and cheese
hmm i was trying to eat healthy over break
haha that's not a bad idea actually
what should i make for dinner
aww the johnny depp lizard killed a bird
haven't seen the last one though
POC is the best movie franchise ever
alright just throwing it out there
it's really really weird
aw it's that animated movie where Johnny Depp voices a lizard
i'm watching Rango right now
haha i was going to say that
i'm hungryy
i leave a nightlight on
yeah that too
ohhh i'm horrible
which is why i'm not helping her
i know

ALL DAY MOTHAFUCKA
in little personalized discussion groups
and then thursday we come in and talk about the book we read over the summer
we come in and spend 10 min at every class
it's not really school
well
nooo stop
kaylie my last day of summer :(
you're never getting my EMT advice again
i feel bad
<3
haha
fine
nooooo
i'm sorry
:(
if you do that a couple times and you don't get any relief at all i would definitely invest your time in finding painkillers
then breath out again
like pretend you're a board
and gently straighten out yourself
now take a big breath in
okay take a couple deep deep breaths
i may add...
my professional advice
do you want my advice...
i'm sorry :(
i get it haha
very snotty
haha that came out snotty
yeah hon that's called a cramp
like does it ever move anywhere/go away?
does the pain go anywhere else?
i presume curling in the fetal position helps...
okay does anything make it better or worse?
?
so you said it was like a stabbing pain/
good choice
hmmm what did you eat...
and what were you doing then?
when did the pain start...
wait hold on let me assess you
cramps...
oh
a lady problem...
i'm assuming this is a girl thing
sorry haha
you could have said that up front...
okay well than you know what the problem's for
ew
have you ever had this pain before...
a "cramp"
would you describe it as
that rules out aeortic distension
is it swollen...
that rules out organ failure
well that's good
if you could average out the pain to one little spot where would it be in relation to your belly button
where does it hurt...
okay...
...
do you want me to assess you
yes
take some pain meds
but it could be heaven if you were here
it is :(
for a day
you should visit my school
now i miss you
mehh
meh go to sleep
wanna hug?
i feel cool :)
i'm the tallest and the lightest in my family :D
guess shvat
meh
he was so cute
i know :(
but i know him from a lot of other stuff
i actually never saw the green mile
D: NOOOO
THAT DUDE DIED?
OH SHIT

i've never seen him wear a suit...
like all the time
and he wears like synthetic clothes
huuuge muscles and a pony tail :D
he's like 5' 3
haha
yeah my dad has a ponytail
he does that
haha
oh yeah
did he or she or whatever know him?
wtf
which is one room over
i'm in my room
my dad is in the kitchen and he texts me to take out the trash
noooo shh
he probably wasn't trying to
i mean he knows i always text you
and i don't think he does...
there we go
why cause he's big haha?
or get amanda to
punch him back
and that's pretty funny actually
haha i guess it is
i'm sorry
he doesn't like her :(
or the lamb noise?
or facebook and Jason?
about Jason and prom?
haha you are precious
haha that's sooooo awkward
haha he thought it was funny <3
or lamb thing
i told him about the goat thing
mah best fran :D
after that...
hmm idk i think he might have just stopped going
...because he was hanging out with me
yeah because he missed the first meeting
yesss :( poor jason
but yes it really, really, sucks
idk we have a youtube channel too so he might just focus on that
and is still kinda arguing over it
he contacted customer service or whatev
he might haha he's not sure yet
yeaaaaah it really does haha
aaaaand now it's gone forever :(
and so did his facebook...
...
soooooo the page got taken down by facebook
...
and turns out that may be entirely illegal
but he puts it under company/entertainment or something
and he does...
*group
he's like "Oh! I'm gonna make a facebook page for our grouop"
yesterday
and so at this point
and as Amanda probably knows, Jason is constantly posting pretty weird stuff about videogames and graphic design and gaming and stuff like that
so we came up with a new one
i doubt it, but anyway
or they stole from us haha i don't know
a bigger videogame thing coincidentally took the same name for their channel
but recently
*group
and like anything cool we did we like put under the name of this grouo
organization whatever
Jason and I formed like a little group
and at one point
and another huge common interest we have is videogames...
this was after he started going to souderton
we both kinda turned into nerds
and a few years back
go way back
Jason and I, as you know
so
ok
are you ready...
let me explain this
haha so jason lost his FB
okay

when she comes into my room she plops down right where i put mah head on the pillow
haha you both actually have really similar personalities
and she walks like a drunk
her ears are droopy :D
hehe when she gets up

most people never get that opportunity
i snuggle her every morning
she's lucky
we're takin her to the vet
WTF SO NOT COOL

bye
:(
uhm
oh
do it
you little demon
you're welcome
i'll spare you
you wouldn't like it
haha i found it
i'm looking for it
you're lying
haha have you ever seen that fucked up parody of the walmart commercial with the homicidal smileys?
haha me and smileys
:D
you are a topaz among diamonds
:D
haha
yes
c'mon guess
you know this
getting warmer
know what i'm going to make?
my mom got a new blender
dingg
like wow hehe
ahaha yeah i was actually a bit taken back by that
you and your social media
omg
no that's good haha
whats number one
oh sweet
mreep
brb
haha just kidding no he doesn't!
and he loves you
?
was that tosh.0
spontaneous mean-ness
just
that's like going up to someone and just throwing paint at them
haha that is so cruel
haha
i know
that is so not cool haha
omg
okay hold onnn
haha
but...
the innocent thing going for her
it would be funnier if she had like
haha that's actually kind of funny
that's better than excessive cursing
when it's out of character usually
like
hahaha omg i LOVE it when girls curse
i know you do
haha
i don't think mine would care too much
hahaha
wow
oh
how'd she take that?
ohhh eek haha
makes me want to vomit and stab a baby cow
haha i'm thinking about superficial girls
like i'll say i'm okay with it, but internally it really bothers me
i don't voice it
it can be really annoying haha
LOL
haha i think any other girl would hate me for that
i'm usually too clingy
emotional detachment
well
i'm practicing my physical detachment with this girl
i'm ready
come do it
anyway
hm
so
i got the impression he lacked self control though
hmm probably not
yeah
if he's insane as she
haha
i hope so
eh
that's the net issue
because if she is hypersensitive then her dad would kick my ass
there we go
i won't do anything you WOULD dissaprove of
wait
i won't do anything you wouldn't dissaprove of
the bottomline is
haha
haha
okay
are you getting this?
if a guy did it to you
but that wouldn't necessarily hurt you..
if i didn't want to go into a relationship, she might be hurt by that
i'm saying
so like
that would hurt you, if it were you in her position
i won't do anything to her
so
yeah
haha i wouldn't do anything to her that i guess if a guy did to you would make you hurt? idk but most girls don't have a thick wall of emotional numbness towards physical attachment like someone
like someone
but most girls don't have a thick wall of emotional numbness towards physical attachment
idk
if a guy did to you would make you hurt?
that i guess
haha i wouldn't do anything to her
girls can be hypersensitive?
kaylie
comandeer the conversation
okay sure
what if he hunts me down and kills me?
very clever
haha like what if
eek
and that supposedly he almost did with her ex
ever hurt her, he would hunt them down and kill them
if any boy
that like
her mom is telling me
and while he's out doing something
her dad is like this huge 6 '1'' ish guy
but anyway
which is weird
everyone in her family is like a black belt in karate or something like that
by the way
and
I'm at EMT girl's house
so anyway
three and three
wow
both actually
you're good
wow
guess what happened to me
so okay
dude
brb
depending on who's around
your cat makes me want to commit suicide and/or homicide
that makes me laugh

by a lot
haha

DESI
waiting for me to drop food

forgotten
abused

i can take being a second priority in small doses
it's cool
hi
kaylieee
brbbb
and tell them something totally wrong
and drop their books
and call students the wrong names
like when i bash into lamps
haha i'm really awkward though
i'm a fuckin great teacher
and like without me having to tell him to he just improved this whole song
i was so happy
so i took him on a crash course on chord theory and he started improvising!
haha he finished his stuff like 7 or 8 minutes early
no haha we were on a pretty first name basis
you woulda thought he was hot
although i did have a student my age
i'm an adult
to a six year old
haha shut up
how many of your teachers do you call by their first name
because I'm their teacher
that like hurts my ears
i don't want to even hear that
plus who the fuck wants to say Mr. Petrochko
it's a very first name thing
Mr. Jason
haha
Mr. Tyler
they call me
but after the like third lesson i just stopped saying anything
like 10000x times
"it's okay"
and i find myself going
like every time
"oh woops sorry"
"oh woops sorry"
"Oh woops worry"
like
they always say the exact same thing
and they mess up
when they're playing
usually
that ALL kids do this
i think it's funny
stop guessing Karis
"C?"
still nope
"B?"
nope
"A?"
nope
"G?"
and she'll be like

anyway, I should probably get started on the last tidbit of hw left
I didn't want to have to do anything during wrestling season
yeah
I wrote almost all of them already :(
like Rice, Umichigan, Lehigh maybe, NYU, Schreyer, Washington st Louis
hmm I was planning on applying to like 13 colleges but now it's just between those three and Yale!
mmhmm, you'd have no idea from the center of it
mmmmmmmmmm
and god their campussssss
yep I agree
so awesome
dude I love it there
btw I'm still applying to Harvard and Columbia too
oh sweet, yeah I'm sure it'll all be fine
colleges are super easygoing with all the common app issues
it'll be fine, my stuff got fucked up too!
kidding dude haha that's awesome
bad Maia!
alright cool cool
haha
I know it can be annoying
if you don't mind me asking!
oh sweet - are Penn and/or Yale on there?
haha who knows, I might change too. so you're still looking at schools?
oh really? I thought I was legitimately the only person going to Yale for compsci ;D
any compsci?
hahaha I'm so honored dude. What are their majors?
we visited Penn together?!?!
MAIA
I early actioned there so I'm not committed but it alleviates so much stress
Yale :D :D
lots of wrestling still haha
hey that's super cool! and I've been well, got into college which is nice ;D
the one rule - fire drills must be held on the coldest day possible
ahh that's good haha
haha it was still epic! what're you up to btw these days?
holy fuck that was funny
I watched that video you posted of that guy James Altschul
Maia!
i do haha!
haha yeah
i was just there to support my teammates haha it was terrible
that day i didn't have any matches
wait actually
they all kinda blend together
haha i actually don't remember how i did at that specific tournament
i spent the entire day at a wrestling tournament, so it could have been better
haha it was alright actually
aw thanks Maia <3

haha she doesn't have a name
hmm
<3

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8n5AJmR0hQ
Haha no, it's a Berlin club as well
such a damn cool club
Hahaha google the club "Adagio Berlin"
Latin American Spanish, British/Australian, Italian, Germans, Turkish, Berliners
friendliest to meanist
I think my ranking atm is
or Berliners, at least
Sooo all of the nice peopl I've on my Germany trip have not been Germans haha
Yah. Fun fact, hard core German peeps are not super nice
super peaceful
Hamburg is dope
Oh Hamburg
The club?
and came back, all with no phone
Today I went to Hamburg
Ya. It's pretty liberating, no phone you know
Haha I think I have one too, I got my 5 when it first came out
Haha no I'm still in the clear
arsechlöß

vielen dank Herr jamie
other than through you
as I have literally no way to communicate with mom and dad
haha im putting you on this
okay
cooool did you get my email
haha if you tell me whats important i can find one for you
hows your computer search going
so it's an unfathomable amount of beer
some of my messages arent sending btw
and people go to biergartens to drink and kick back at like 6pm
everytime ive left a club its been still filling up
and leave at 7-9am
go to a club at 2-3am
which is at 330 or 4am
then they pregame
so basically people chill at bars or smoke hookah 10pm to 1am
people start pregaming at 1am
its literally like nyc on steroids
but I just cannot keep up with the parties here
dude I thought Id never say it
email?
trying to figure out how to use everything
using a german computer
yahh one sec
at a club called suicide circus berlin
yep
sooo could you tell mom and dad that my flight gets in at 3:45 pm on tuesday???
but I need someone to pick me up at the airport
sooooo TyTy lost his phone in Germany
but hold on
you're probably not up yet
Heyy bud can you do me a favor
󾮟🏼󾮟🏼
You do it hehe
Ok yeah I'm down
I'd be down, I don't have armor tho
That will prob be my first day back. Why? That Andrews funeral?
󾍇 pretty damn nice
Really? Because of the thing with Andrew Radke
Where? Berlin?
That really really blows
Damn 󾌣 well fuck
Diabetes related?
Wait what?? How?
^good luck
Haha say Viel Gluck
In Munich now
Yeh
Wish me luck
Okay boarding plane
Lots of stories though
Haha nah 󾌣
Dude there are like literally "panther crossing signs"
You have to be one locísimo motherfucker
󾮟🏾 will do. Don't kills yourself bae. Also if you wanna test your shit you should try the third world highway test
Haha nice lmao. Got you something from India. Want it to be a surprise or you wanna know now?
also supposed to be faster and less buggy, which is good
It looks super dope
29th
19th maybe?
July something
That's okay, most laptops come with 8
If you have windows 8, it's a free upgrade, though
and I don't have the preview, it's not out yet
model*
Also the dev team switches after every mode
Haha, exactly, right?
Fill in the blank haha
Windows 98 = great, Windows NE = bad, XP = great, Vista = bad, Windows 7 = great, Windows 8 = bad, Windows 10 = ???
and 10 is super good
It's super cheap, with an i5 processor 900
You should consider a Dell XPS 13 inch
There's a reason Macs don't use the touch screen, plus Windows 10 is drifting from Windows 8's touchscreen dependency
Yeah good idea
By the way, I'd recommend no touch screen
Also add touch screen to that list haha
Cons: bad viewing angles on the screen (two people definitely cannot watch a movie at the same time on it), no mute button
Pros: great processor, decent graphics card (most computers don't come with one), nice keyboard, way better specs than most computers at its price range
Mine is super good for me. I don't think you would like it, honestly
also add screen size to that list
mine was $900, I got a four year warranty so it went up to $1100
Like most XPSs are like 1600+ I think
Dope. Most good ones are above 1200
Ohhh nice any price range??
Ohhh nice that's dope
and add screen resolution to the list, keeping in mind that super high resolution is not always a good thing
Don't worry about laptop storage and hard drive vs ssd
Macs are very very good machines, only a tad overpriced in my opinion and not very good longer down the road
Haha just checking
also you want windows right?
Just put em in order and give me specifics for important ports/drives, keyboard specifics, and screen type
Hmm, gimme your price and take some time to put these in order: thin/lightweight, high processing power, high graphics card (mostly for gaming and some extremely difficult applications, realistically shouldn't matter), durability, screen type/quality (matte vs glossy), any ports/drives that are important (usb, sd, cd/dvd, hdmi, ethernet), any keyboard specifics (let me know if any are super important, i.e. being backlit, having numpad, large arrow keys, having a mute button), keyboard quality (like how good it feels, which affects typing speed), and trackpad
haha what for?
July 17 I think
So insane
http://www.businessinsider.com/what-ai-inceptionism-dreams-look-like-2015-6
Dude it's 3:00 AM haha
No, but I should probably tell her before I commit
She's leaving for college like the day we get back
It's 3:00 AM, I gotta check with gf tomorrow
Yeah I'm investigating.
Kelly *
I.e. not jelly
She's bad man. You need a good person who supports you
Dude, don't
keep em in the crisper drawer
Nah, just store em raw
Yeah but it's not really leftovers
lasts like 4-6 meals
Sometimes I just buy a bunch of veggies, cut em all up, and throw em in big gallon bags in the fridge
so?
:(
Being healthy is uber expensive
Oh yeah, that is true
Why not?
Veggies is the way to go man
yeah exactly
I mean, does it bother you though haha?
Oh that's not that bad
Haha how much you weigh?
Yeah that'll do it. Broccoli usually gets me
Well that's good
It means you're getting enough fiber, but a lot of times it's only when you make a switch to a higher-fiber diet
Usually good haha
I have no idea, they're just way bigger than I thought
http://cdn2.getyourguide.com/img/tour_img-152490-48.jpg
at least a foot or two bigger than a horse
yeah they have just super long legs
like way bigger than a horse
also camels are deceptively large
dude they are SO big
Nah dude haha that's super bad
Riding it?
Wrong person haha but good

Yeah hahaha
Did not know they could fly
I also saw them fly

I also saw wild peacocks
Only half decent pic I got

I'm pretty sure. It freaked out when I got near but it was like a weird stretchy groundhog
Saw a wild ferret today
No haha we always read the same articles
fucking god damn it
fucking great article
http://munchies.vice.com/articles/what-its-like-as-a-bartender-to-watch-your-awkward-tinder-date?utm_source=munchiesfbus&utm_medium=dark&utm_campaign=tinder
too*
you have to just walk into traffic and hope that people slow down, cuz it's to busy to wait for a break in traffic
And like, crossing the street is fucking terrifying too
it's like a giant game of chicken
you just kinda go for it
if you try to like "wait for your turn" you'll never get anywhere
and there's like hundreds of them on a single traffic roundabout
yeah it's horrifyingly scary
and they like swerve through traffic, passing buses on one-lane roads
like all scooters/motorcycles you pass have like a dad driving, a little kid behind him, and a mother on the back riding side-saddle while holding a baby
But it's pretty cool... they all ride side-saddle on motorbikes
It's kinda offsetting once you notice it
You don't really see many women in the street either haha
Haha bro, a lot of them don't show their faces in public. They wear veils
Relative to the US atleast
Haha also India is super sexist.
MMMMMmmmm
Mmmmmm sex
date?
Yeah, I'm where you'll be in nine and a half hours
So I'm turning in soon
Haha go for it. It's almost 1 AM here
?
Haha fucker, it was some crazy shit
You read it?
Lol I'll try
Hahaha I'm always happy here man
so idk, maybe something related to weed
Hahaha I haven't actually seen any, but when we burned the stuff it gave off a wicked weed smell
The shit grows wild here.
Also I didn't mention it, but the stuff we burned mighta been a weed hybrid
I have pictures but I didn't upload them because they're slightly incriminating
https://khushity.wordpress.com/2015/06/04/warzone-udaipur/
hold on I'll link you, you gotta read it
and got stung in the face twice lol
but like the next day he opened the window to taunt them
yeah totally separate
Nope, but like the next day
This was after the beehive thing
not good
We had a bee incident...
dude two days ago...
haha yeah, you'd think
bare*
then hunts down all the bees and crushes them to death
We woke up one morning and a beehive was forming inside our apartment, dude walks over, and smashes the whole thing with his bear hands
he's this huuuuuge fuckin Muslim-Indian bear
Nah he's kinda a mix of like guide, servant, health worker, assistant, and body guard
He's from a more northern state, and he's like a senior at a muslim university
Not bad at all, it just swatted at him, but the dude is fucking crazy
and it swung its head around and clobbered him ahahahaha
Haha this dude we're staying with tried to sit on one that was like, laying down
so you can just pet bulls in the street
Yeah. I think my fav thing is that, because they're holy animals, cows can go wherever they fuckin' please
Yep, haha.
dick a-flopping
just casually
for a religious service
I saw a naked guy walking in the street the other day lol
Like it's next-level high kinda stuff.
and it's all like BEWARE
I looked it up online
Super high
Yep haha
and it's basically mashed up marijuana blended with milk/yogurt.
that they drink on special occasions like Holi
They have a drink called Bhang Lassi
Haha no the city I'm in is like the religious capital
Also they way overcharge foreigners, even though I'm with natives
so like 20 cents for the elephant ride
there's about 60 rupees to the dollar
Oh you have to pay him like 10 ruppees
Also no tips here
They would worship you
hahahaha
Dude a $1 tip
Yeah, idk you're not supposed to even if they offer.
Nah dude, super bad for the Elephants apparently
He said I could ride it lol
Yeah haha
I pet an elephant that was just riding on the street
like every block has at least two cows, eight stray dogs, and an ox
And fucking cows, buffaloes, oxen, goats, donkey, and pigs just wander in the street
like super-cheap taxis
An auto is the thing James Bond was in when he hit the dude with a tennis racket
I was in an auto
No road rules, everyone travels in an auto (golf cart thing) or on a motorcycle or scooter
My first time riding on the road... man I almost had a heart attack
Roads are fucking insane though.
Equivalent of like a $40/person place here.
Most expensive dish was like $8
We saw a fancy restaurant today, right on the lakefront, rooftop tables
Although I had some great Bel Phuri.
I try to stick for stuff that's like boiled or heated
Haha yeah, I mean I've been fine so far.
Haha yep. Street food is like 30 cents for a samosa dish, 20 cents for Tea
Yep, haha
and a new meal every day
And it's an insane amount of food, and gets delivered to our door
Haha little more, $1.80
guess
go on
Guess how much we spend on food per day
Traveling is so much better when you do shit with like the locals, and skip all the tourist-ey shit
So I just kinda follow their lead.
Plus everyone else on my team is like fluent or half-fluent
Haha pretty hard. Most peeps know some English though.
Haha chilling in the streets of India, going to villages where they're giving out vaccines, meeting locals, learning Hindi, and programming
Like, two years ago everyone used computers to mine bitcoins, but now it's all done with dedicated asic controllers operating in like mega-warehouses
Yeah no sweat, if you need anything explained I can help out. A lot of stuff regarding bitcoins has changed recently, so it's hard to get good info
bitcoins are super important
Also good topics that I don't know much about: dark web, silk road, tor
^profit
Like literally, the steps involved in a MITM attack are so easy, you can google it, install some shit, and do it in like an hour
Given that there's a hacker on the same network as you, i.e. sitting in the same Starbucks.
Well, it makes it super easy to steal your shit.
That's what fucks you over when you do your banking on a starbucks network
Another good topic is man-in-the-middle attacks.
haha
Are you though
Haha
Nice
also wtf r u saying
It's similar to a DDOS attack, where you form a huge network of infected computers, who work together
Also Botnets are a good topic, they're pretty fuckin sweet. The big keyword there is Conficker.
Lol.
It's like making a virus that turns people into zombies that attack the whitehouse.
all DDOS attacks. It's basically writing a virus to infect thousands of computers, and they all turn on a single server to bring the fucker down
You know the Sony hackings and stuff?
Also you should talk about DDOS attacks, they've been huge in the news the past two years.
Is it like a class or what?
Yeah I could go on for a while about cyber security stuff.
When? Where?
Also saw a monkey, went to a village with people who had never seen a white person
Yeah dawg, I petted an elephant on the highway today haha
Actually mom posted about it on fb so you def saw it either way haha
Yo did I send you my blog yet?
I don't think this list is for engineers though
^ happy life man

today I had oatmeal, peanut butter, grapefruit, and a salad with almonds, quinoa, grapes, and admittedly some feta
hmm a lot of vegetables, hummus, nuts, oatmeal, eggwhites, beans/legumes, sometimes soy
I eat nothing processed, no refined carbs, no red meat, little saturated fat, more protein, no added sugars
literally every single way?
chicken turkey fish shellfish
nah like all meat
/fish
oh yeah, I stopped eating meat too btw
during wrestling season not at all
I use protein powder very rarely my friend
I no longer see "being willing to eat a certain food" as being a respectable trait haha

I was more talking about like the whole meal replacement thing

yeah, and so far 100/100 in CS
multivariable calculus 144/150
yep, I killed my first midterm
alright I got work to do though
'twas awesome
with neon paint and shit
haha but the next night we threw a SICK blacklight party on the first floor
this was on Friday haven't seen much of him since then
idk yet
yeah haha I think the kid might be fucked
so like a shit ton of firemen, cops, and the dean, and all the RAs talked to the eight of us and shat on Willl
like our suite is fucking disgusting, and yeah our bathroom which is right between our two suites
the fire extinguisher went off in the bathroom
noo our suite is always a mess haha
but Will told them what happened, and he got chewed out for like HOURS
and wouldn't even believe us lol for a while
so they thought the party was in OUR room
and basically, our suite is a fucking MESS and Will's suite is like impeccably clean
well the Dean was there and they wanted to talk
I could've went to another dorm, but they wanted to question us
while they cleaned out the chemicals and shit
yeah so like we had to wait outside for HOURS
and the fog that was shooting out was like that propellant shit
and the dust and chemicals and shit were basically coating the entire inside of the tower
and it basically covered the entire bathroom in like a wall of white powdery paint
and released all the propellant at the same time into the air
some drunk dumbass dropped a fire extinguisher
and turns out it wasn't even a fire though
yeah so everyone got out
and we're all like whaaat the fuckkkk?
and there's like, a jet of smoke or fog or something SHOOTING out of the window
and we look up to Will's room
I'm freezing my ASS off
and we're all standing out in the courtyard which is like 40 degrees
so we all ran out
and I'm like SHIIIIT ITS A FIRE
and like people are scrambling to get out
and literally there is a fucking thick-ass wall of smoke rolling down the stairs
to grab a shirt
so I leave the bathroom to run up to my suite
and I'm like, shiiiit not another drill
and the fuckin fire alarm is goin crazy
then suddenly lights are flashing and alarm sounds
and since the bathroom is gross from the party, I go down to the first floor in just my pajama pants to brush my teeth and crap
and like a few other people hang out in one place or another
so the girls go off to bed
and we get kicked out, AGAIN
the entire debate team comes BACK
and then a few hours later, like 2:00 or 3:00
and like 10-12 people are hanging out in there
so we repopulate his sweet
but like, eventually, the debate team goes somewhere else
it was Friday night and my Jewish friends weren't allowed to drink or eat so nobody did much exciting
so he and some of my other friends basically just hung out outside and chilled and whatnot
and like one of my best buds is in that suite
he basically bans all his suitemates from their suite
and soo while he's having this party
mind you this fellow is a freshman, and yale debate team is like undergrads, grad students, yadda yadda
and he has the entire debate team over for a party
has this dude Will, who's kind of a dick sometimes but tall and pretty gay and on the debate team
and the suite across from mine
each suite has two rooms, each with two people
so our floor has two suites, each with four people
okay so craziest shit ever
wait hold on lemme restart chrome
dude I never told you
it's great yo hbu?
ciao

I went to one at the Basketball frat last night
and a lot of variability
september 12 or something like that
haha
yo Yale plays Lehigh soon
It was 96° too haha
Me at the end haha
It was like at midnight last night while I was stretching. Boom. I think it'd be cool to go even farther, like I feel like 80 miles isn't impossible
Idk why my hamstring muscle pops every now and then, and that muscle is like out of commission for like 4 days or so. Happened on the other leg right before states so I had to go through states and nationals with it haha
You bet haha. I was stretching my hamstring yesterday and heard the loudest pop I have ever heard come from a body part
nah dad picked me up then thank god
yep. they won't let you on with it between 4:00 and 6:30 so I chilled at the train station for a while
took the train haha
Haha*

i'll have her take it
yeah mom will be home in 10
we'll see
idk
and right now i'm like freezing as fuck and i can't stop shivering
yeah
haha 9/20 people on our wrestling team are out sick
and until 2:00 today
and then i slept all day yesterday
projectile vomiting
i was up till 7 in the morning
like sunday night
the last two days
horribly horribly sick
i have been like
dude on that very same topic
haha get some
lot's of outrageous sex
haha it'll be a good time
that's pretty awesome actually
nice nice ice
oh nice
oh haha was gonna say
in the morning??
that's actually pretty cool
!
sweet yo1
it's fine yo
gnite man
aight i'm done for the night
haha sweet yo
/vaporizers and shit
haha there was a discussion in the locker room today about the best bongs
woah that's pretty sweet actually
yeah haha i never did
lemme see
no haha
etc.
chanting
and started cheering
and instantly everyone in the stadium stood up
and i got the major
he got called for stalling again
and just as the buzzer went off
and i need one more point
and there's a few seconds left
three fuckin times
and he got called for stalling
he'd back up again
i'd take a fake shot
he'd back up
i was slamming on his head,
and i just fuckin blitzkriegged his ass
and he got up
so coach had me cut him
and i needed to be up by 8 to get the major
and then i was up by 7
took him down some more
he managed to escape
almost pinned him a few times
i took him down
and i kicked his ass haha
and i went out
and people were crowded in all the doorways, etc.
up against the wall
people were forced to sit actually on the mat
the little gym is fucking packed
so i went out
which likely neither would
one of the two remaining wrestlers has to score a major
and if i win by a minor decision
and our streak
and we lose the interac
it's impossible for GA to win
and if i lose my match
and i have to go
the kid before me wins
32-18
we're down
and as i'm on deck
at the match
and so GA was doing pretty badly
so i'd have to wrestle 132
coach hill told me Kristian would be wrestling 138
and when we were warming up
since this was the first time malvern was expected to win
probably of the last 4 or 5 years actually
so it was our most anticipated match of the year
oh
blowin trannies all day
oh
shvat
i'm narrowing down the issue
haha yeah
sure
hmm if i can get this working
np bro
there we go
it'll be brief though
i think i'm gonna try a network-wide haymaker
hmm
are you guys on the internet?
hm
brb
take two
alright
same concept though
haha no cain and abel
that's a step in the right direction
i successfully kept myself off the internet from another computer
it half worked
haha sort of
it's prettcool shit
so its only 192.168.1.6 as opposed to our entire network
i isolated to specifically my computer
nope
tink its working
ho shit
pray for me nigga
brb
gonna retry dis shit
well i think i just made some progress
alright
then you worry
if the problem persists
you'll probably get kicked off the internet for a couple seconds
at some point tonight
but i'm warning you
idk
id
haha
and burn
like it'll die
to death
literally
yeah
like hack it to fucking death
i'm about to hack the shit out of our network
haha maybe
comin back up tho
coming down for a drink
brb
linux is being a bitch
sort of
very inefficient
soooo when you're hacking yourself you don't get too much surprising info
with hacking you're supposed to steal other people's shit
well
and btw hacking yourself is actually not a very useful tactic
wow that sounded dirty
haha nah i'm hacking myself
i'm eating bitch

on average 274
took mine
on average
.1 millisecond
what took one of them
wow...
and at its worst...
it did slightly worse than the best ones
at its best
presidents day
of my own personal data structure against all the top data structures
hey i just finished my science fair and got the results
nope
nah i'll probably get up around noon
and you're both Jamie Petrochko
i hope you get married
ahahah well you'll either do really well or semi-badly
what
is she the chubby one?
hmmm i have no clue
or your grade?
he's a senior now?
it'll get better
:( i'm sorry man
that sucks :(
eh aite
tough love
i don't know enough about it
haha your choice
gotcha dude
haha no see i actually wish kels and i talked more
a little bit
haha good question
we grinded
noope haha
awk
really
after really
at semi not really
nice woman
oh cool
yeah college is nasty
ew that sounds nasty
ouch why
cool haha
wow
what'd you do?
er maybe
lmao no that's date rape and the second one is arson and vandolism
haha there's some fly slang term for it
you put like a tablet in the beer and it makes it foamy
there's a name for the practice...
could be
what's that thing with the funnel where you make the beer super foamy?
we just never went
i said yeah
he said "You should come drinking with me and the boys"
yeah like the senior
Keith Corliss invited me to go drinking with him once and i said alright just never followed up
nopee
at college i'm fine with it? it just bothers me a little bit when you do it excessively at home
no im not i just don't like the taste of booze
just really weird
haha well not a fag
every MIT person i know is a fag
why would i want that?
noo haha
not at all haha
that sucks
ah no way why?
if i get super lucky
yeah MIT's #1
my focus drifted towards the end
yeahhh
today
yeppp
there was a big one today but i didnt go cuz of SATs
thanks dude
leaving at seven
yeahhhh six haha
hopefully wrestling tourneys cancelled tomoro
aites i gtg
is it snowin there
nope
ima vidchat with my friend soon
i wanna live to get my full license
haha aite
haha yeah that's not a good idea
wow haha
really?
well, to barnbridge
dad let me drive the truck home from the DMV
yeah why not
yeahh hahah
before
it was fifty
65
yo they changed the num of hours you need for your license
sweeet haha
yeppp
yeah
there are hundreds of those operations going on per second in my program haha
so 9%2=1
it finds like the remainder
because nine divided by seven is one remainder TWO
9%7 is two
nah
do you get what X is?
X= 9%7
haha if i said
yerp modular algebra
how does it look
if (((x%15)%7))=2 then x is a set of array 2, position [2((int) x/(60/4))+((int) (X%(60/4)%(56/8))]%8
okay good luck haha
i don't really need sleep
i'll still be up till like 1
yeah probably
haha oh i stopped for a little while
yeah def
yet
idk

i'm not talkin to natalie alicia and i are getting along
not my type
nah not really
not good
idk
she looks like my advisor
idk haha
yeh
l8r nigs
ty
pray to buddha for an easy quiz
im going to go to bed
well
cool shit
ALDIFH
OMG
subatomic particles????
Quantum Ionization
i had to learn it for the Phsyics SATII
love that crap
i mean CH4
ahh methane is CH3
like something from silent hill
that'd look sweet
yeah ik
could be
N2O nitrous oxide
CH3 methane
si
nitric oxide
yeah
H2O H2O2 NH3 CH3 NO N2O
yeah
nah we got a list
like H2O2
i need to look back over the ones that make no sense whatsoever
yeah
i thought NH3 was Nitrogen Trihydride
eh i did pretty well
nitride and nitrite
i just confused nit
no ionic
thats lithium nitride
Li3N
no
nitride
i confused nitrite
-ide
waiiiit nvm
how can that be covalent theres a metal
Lithium Nitride
wait wtf
im checkin'
theres an answer sheet
lets see
yah
brb
practice for da quiz
yeah and u already took it
see how i do
well lemme do the worksheet
yeah
agreed
not opening the wormcan
okay
can't they just share electrons
since theres oxygen
why doesn't it just form like O2
yeah
so like look at an Oxide Anion
its just
i get that
yes yes yes
but like
yeah so net charge is +1
yeah i get all that
what causes ions
oaky
but like
yeah i get that
well i'm fucking confused but w/e
ah
oh
si
why doesn't that turn them into cations?
yeah
oh
like sharing electrons
but like what keeps the other one together
i get how a ionic compound is formed
like
and what exactly is that
like molecular?
what's covalent
wouldn't that be Iron(III) Oxide
where it gives me the name i give the formula and charge
the hard way
and wooo got an 100% on quizlet
wait if a compound has a metal in it or ammonium its ionic rite
10th grade is when they let all the retards into honors so it gets a thousand times easier
way way way easier
way
it's weird
like a writeup on how to do a problem
yeahh
but that's trivial
a paper due every now and then
haha
none
yeahhh aha he's so easy though
he'ss soo fucking easy
Straub
i got in tho
there werent enough people for alg-precalc
Alg 2
he like went insane
we wouldn't stop talking
he's flipped once lol
he has the most objective tone of anyone i have ever met
he's like
i'm so incredibly unsure
is janders gay
they're chill
blah
yeah
its the oxygen that fucks with me
idk
phospherous
yeah
and phosphurous
wild guess ftw
yeah it is i have the sheet
yeah bitch
MnO4 -?
lemme think
ehrmm
yerp
thiocyanate
just not the other way around yet
ehh if you show the symbol i can get the name
yeah ik
CrO4 2-
chromate
okay
Cr2O7 2-
Dichromate
but like
yeahh got that too
i get that a lil bit
yeah
shit yeah typo
Chlorite ClO2 -
Hypochlorite ClO2 -
or should i just memorize like
is there any reason behind the ions
no way its fucking memorization
and the charges
*polyatomic
i have to memorize all the polyatmoic ions
Nomenclature
yea
giant chem quiz tomoro
chill
okay
certainly a possibility
ask them to send it to ur college
wow smooth
that was after she friended me
wtF?!?!
its def some 80 year old guy
lol iikr?

idk i think i did well
first test wednesday
bitte
nice cool beans
playing piano for first friday today
yes indeed it is the weekend my derogatory african american friend
you probably won't do it in matlab and maybee not even arduino its pretty advanced shit
its a method that calls itself
it's like a snake eating itself
it'll fuck your brain inside out
wait till you get to recursion
yeahh see input is a method that takes a string as an argument
but yeah they're used in programming a lot
or plug in a variable and spits out something
you plug in a number and it spits out another
literally the same as in calculus?
a function?
haha
foo(){ return 25}
like
functions? procedures? methods?
what do you call methods in matlab?
haha nesting loops is fun
i'd say its coding just not programming
i guess technically it's coding
yeah that's scripting lol
it's more like javascript
java c++ perl python java can all do that ahah
because you can't make an application?
its like scripting
haha it's not really a coding language
matlab sucks
gay
started with arduino yet?
*hear
wow
lol kay
oh cool
?
oh is it vietnam girl
haha remember i'm still planning on going to college
lol have fun

its like a space scene
its sick
ten seconds
control panel-> customization -> disable gadget bar
haha
yes
and it won't get in the way i promise lol
yeah but if you make it full screen it'll probably cover it up
so you will never need to write a note on a piece of paper
and it cant get covered up by other windows
on the side
weeather
cpu usage

ahaha alright i'll pass it along
he gets a discount
hehehhe
haha he's always offering to buy me them
you're not <3
i know hahaha
and she's like reaaaaaallly tiny
she actually has a pretty outstanding body
haha you know looking at her profile pic
tell me what you think of Lauren
OK honestly
i'll stop
okay
ahahaha
whom i can't stalk
even though she has a bf
and Kels is like heavily advocating me and her being a thing
is friends with Kels
also, my soudy crush girl
yeaaaaah haha
grinding woulda been awkward
yeah we didn't like dance much though
0.0
is like over 6 feet tall
the girl i brought to semi
ahaha you know freshman year
ahahaha that would be craaaaazy awkward
buuuuut i'll give it a try haha
so i'm exempt from a lot of it
which is partially because she's in a different grade
called "not judging someone based on their looks and/or social status"
i'm trying out this thing
anyway, this new girl
haha aww <3 thanks hon
and this girl haha
she found my semi date
like she's been giving me rides places
also, dude Kelsey has been like soooo nice to me the last few months
though
this girls bustier
hahaha i think kels is way prettier
what?!
like crazy
she's soooo funny though
i saw that hahaha
i know haha
she's alright haha
i said "but anyway" up there but i don't think it sent
stalk her
Lauren Weiss
but anyway
it is very weird
yes
a little
actually
no why?
haha her name is Lauren Weiss
i think i found a girl to take to prom
yesss that's me
else i would stalk the shiiiiit out of him
does not have a motherfuckin facebook
that my secret crush's boyfriend
it seriously bothers me
hey little one
that's an awful place to die too
wow
how...
shwat?
you go hardcore
wow
tell me
yes
ik haha i saw
woah sorry i'm here
whatsup cracker
hehe
loveeee youuuu
it'll help
listen to the song
by the eagles
Desperado
the song
do you know
fuckin phil
maybe he meant the ones who haven't decomposed yet
okay considering people have been dying since the beginning of the human race and they've only been born in the last 100 years, it's waaaaay bigger than 14 to 1
uhhh i think there are a looooooot more than 14 dead people for every 1 living person...
and i was definitely no angel
i mean, granted, everyone was a prick in 7th grade
people hate to see someone else happy i guesss
idk?
people literally would tease me everywhere
and it was the woooooorst two months of my life
and she and i went out for like two months
in 7th grade, i asked this asian girl out
i mean
and i just feel like, what's the point of a girlfriend if you can't be happy?
*anyway
yeah, my mom just always gets the sense i should do it anway
is when I say something like "there's this one girl that i think is really cute, but if i asked her out i'd never be able to show my face in school again"
and usually where the argument strikes up
that's actually how i feel
haha thanks hon
i guess as long as it's something i can relate to
i'm all ears
haha if there's something you want to talk about though
probably
and how it relates to real life society
it's usually about how awful the social structure of my school is
like it's usually about me though
yeahh
i do with my mom a lot
*actually
let me think actualy
hmm
and i think we're both kinda happy with the status quo
eh it's because meaningful conversations make us change
fuckyou
haha when i try to start them you're like eh
haha we can have meaningful conversations
i would be a sad little meerkat without you
nooo don't feel like that
shhh
you don't deserve to die
no hush
has he talked about her before?
my friend thinks Nathan likes her
never heard of it
noooope
nope
nopw
what book?
hey how are you
what that's fucking stupid
listen i don't think Nathan knows how much of an ass he's being
i promise
like in a good way
literally you've never been anything but super sensitive
it's ridiculous that he'd say that
and you're like so nice to me
i still love you
i'm sorry
that's such bullshit
whatt?
you're like the most easygoing friend ever
that's awful! he's a dick
why? what the fuck
or the guy?
Nathan?? Nathan?
well can you still tell me?
okay
call me
no it's fine
yeah hold on a minute
what happened!?
tell me what happened :/
Kaylie :(
brb
i guess you can be a bitch
haha it's prom
drop some hints
so that way any awkwardness is avoided
we don't say who we're going for
there's an unspoken agreement
with all my friends
honestly
meh i'm sorry :/
okay admittedly that is a pretty fucked up scenario
<3
keep going yo
Gunther
hahaha
ok

but anyway, is this like a go-for-his dick thing?
nah it's cool i hate you too

sorry hon
gotcha :/
zies

oh
idk what that is
are you going with Christo?
ugh fuck prom
how was your day...
cuz i did it at the beginning of the year
and it turns out i've already done like half my bio hw
like i've never just felt to happy after a day
but no it was amazing
and getting beaned in the face in volleyball
like getting yelled at in detention
i downplayed the bad parts
yeah! haha
and then i get to talk to YOU :D
and i discover i have like no hw
and then kelsey asks me to hang with her at our school's play on saturday
and when i get home, i get this crazy achievement in this videogame i play (i know i'm a freak)
stopping to buy food for my homeroom tomorrow
and slept on the ride home
then i had a really awesome convo with my friend liz and this teacher
and we talked for a while
and then kels came along and joined in
and we ended up talking for like 20 minutes
and she stopped to talk to me
and then when i got to my locker, the hot sophomore was just leaving to go to some afterschool art club
and i don't think i've ever been in that lounge
sitting in a neat pile
was my planbook, my planner, and this kid's calculator
and sitting in the middle of the floor
all the furniture had been moved to the outside of the lounge
in one of the house lounges
and literally
and just on a premonition i decided to take a detour to get to my locker
and my college planner
and my planbook
so i lost this kids calculator
shut the fuck up
and lost it
which is like 220 dollars haha
i borrowed some kids calculator
so like a few days ago
and this is the weirdest part
and got like most of my hw done
so i had to go to that
...but niqqa had detention
then after lunch i had select chorus with Sophie again, and afterwards she asked me what i was doing after school
and i spent 45 minutes talking to the two girls next to me and reading this book
so we had a hot fucking substitute
then i had English and my bitch sexist-fucking-teacher was away at some conference
and she laughed like a motherfucka and was cool with it
i was like "our bird is still in embryo..."
and so when my teacher came around
we had made nothing, and all the other groups made these bird things
we were supposed to make paper birds, and at the end
and spent the rest of the class goofing off doing some weird paper-folding lab
and got a 96 on a test
i had bio
then later on in the day
but anyway, we had a pretty sexual conversation
it was a 45 minute period
well, the sophie experience
haha that's the main of it
yeah haha
idk haha European people?
and one pretty intimate one of her in her room...
haha and there were some nudeys
and she let me go through her photos on her phone
but anyway
haha sorry i'm bashful
haha jesus kaylie between her legs
but anyway
so like my knee was... haha
and eventually our legs were like entwined
kept scooching closer
and as we were talking we just like
and these two chairs
like a big desk
with a desk
and it's just this little tiny room
so we were like sitting in these rolling chairs?
haha alright
haha really?
and some showing of pictures...
haha
but there was some foreplay
it's school
haha we didn't hookup
and i was like yeah sure haha
and she was like, want to go find a private study room?
and sophie and i were in the library
then i had a free
and i was just like haha sure whatev man
after gym, some jock from my gym class was talking to me and was like hey wanna smoke pot some time
but anyway
haha hold up we're getting to this
which was superb
then i had gym, and played volleyball
and she and i chatted the whole period long
in which i sit next to that hawty souderton sophomore
haha so the day started out with math
like you don't have to listen
can i tell you about it?
but like so many great little things happened
like nothing speacial happened
haha today was the perfect today
the perfect day?
have you ever had like

haha i think you would have been happy living an exhilerating life into your 40s
and designed for people to live long and kind of boring lives
safe
everything today is so like
i mean,
like the "guard rails" of society
you would be happier without
"civilized" even
and like
everything that makes our society "modern"
but like
hmm can't really explain it
100 years ago
i feel like you would have been happier if you had been born like

i know you too are still close
well what does Amanda think when you kind of dissapear?

have you tried just talking to your mom?
hm i can see where you're coming from
why not?

he would want you to enjoy yourself
i don't

then we all went back to matt's
then we went hiking...
and Matt and I jumped off like a 20 foot rock into 35 degree water
idk if you've ever been there

ugh
and supposedly guys are predisposed to marry girls that look like their mothers
it's freaky
all males have the inward desire to kill off their dad's and love their mothers
and Freud deduced that like
so his mom kills herself
and sexes her up
and takes his mom as his bride
where this Prince unknowingly kills his father
there's this play called Oedipus Rex
...sounds like Froyd
like as in "Don't go all Freudian on my ass"
the psychoanalytic guy
haha do you know who Sigmund Freud is?
it
fuck
Oededipian?
Oedepan?
i'm afraid you're going to develop into some weird Oedipian complex
i'm scared haha
ahhh
and they give me chills...
you love to make weird incestual jokes
ahhh
how's tigolebitties doing?
so she's be like
my mom knows one of my friends as tig 'ol bitties
haha
i have a random spanish test tomorrow
i learned today
:(
:(
fuck you

and it is literally such a fucking detriment to me studying
after another
video
one "cute animal"
i've been watching
ever since i found that mouse video
yo so
oooh that's a good point
i never hear mention of her
btw how's Panda doing?
haha striiiikeout
haha 5 6
uuuuuuuh oh
haha uh oh
hmm how tall is she haha
wow haha she's actually pretty good looking
i'm now in staaaalking mode
also which jess
haha has she seen anything but my profile pic?
<3
shhh
but it's especially hard being me :(
it's hard being me
:(
then send me anthrax in an envelope
probably unfriend me too
instantly
like
i think if i did that on your wall you would delete mah post
do you like mah video
angers me
haha right
it makes me look like a whore
having it on my wall
i don't think it reflects well on me as a person
haha i kind of want to delete it
and i got this text like "YOU BETTER LIKE MY TRUTH IS"
and she texts me all the time
haha she and i met three motherfucking years ago
<3
haha hey Kayliez
goodbye little tulip
i must go
alas
ahh
interesting point
hmm
*excitement
bubbling excitemeny
yeaaaaaaah
hopefully they'll have it by then
my parents are getting a hottub
haha i knew i could rely on you
haha i have never thrown a party before
i knowzya do
i only saw the play haha
yeah i never saw the lion king
i'll try to find some that are chill with outsiders
yeah a lot don't :/
haha i'll let you know when the time rolls around
but outside haha
and sleep over
like have a looooot of people come over
and a campout haha
kind of like a cross between a campfire
i was thinking about having like
honestly
i might have one in the spring
please do <3
she is haha
you two would get a long
and Matt's girlfriend usually hangs with us so it wouldn't like be weird...
haha you would fit in really well with our guy crowd
that was pretty fucking awkward
and as you can imagine
ontop of each other in a giant pile
and we're all entirely wrapped up in blankets
two girls come down and are like we can't find any pillows
five minutes in
but like
yeah pretty much
and we started playing it...
to like, ya know, sleep
so we waited for all the girls to go upstairs
we should try this
were like hey
so Matt Miller, and my two other friends at this party
but it's the sort of thing like you always laugh about but never ever do
i know it sounds VERY WEIRD
while wrapped in blankets
and then you just crawl over each other
you and a bunch of other people do it
and like
is a game where you wrap yourself in a blanket
hear me out
so Nightcrawlers
i'm going to tell you
well
awkward...
oh...
Matt and I
hehe
the game
do you know what nightcrawlers is...?
and never poked me back
she posted about a poke war
to make it even worse
that actually infuriates me haha
for some reaason
and she posted on my wall about it >:(
i poked back at the last person who poked me
so when you poked me
save the slow lorises
aw
and they die in captivity :(
aw
aw what the hell
the poisonous ones
you can get their teeth removed
IM DOIN IT NOW
:( meh but they're so cute
nooooo
no no no
nooooo :(
or if they bite you you die?
like so if you eat them you die?
seriously?
what really?
i'm going to buy you a slow loris
i love you
<3
hehe
12 other people?
idk
where there was a party with like
Matt took us to his house
anyway
ITS FROM FUCKIN MENS WAREHOUSE IT WAS EXPENSIVE AS SHIT
BTW SOME ASSHOLE TOOK MY JACKET
drove us all to his house
<3
then Matt Miller
that was awkward
i'm like tf??
and she insistently is all like "i'm really sorry"
and i was like oh that's chill
my date was like heyy uhm i'm not really into slow dancing
uhm when a slow dancing song came around
well anyway
*really?
realy?
like, i wouldn't
^yeah i don't really expect you to read this all
then reapearred
my date got really boring and disappeared for a while
then uhm
so i had to give them the whole birds and bees convo...
and some of my underclassmen friends were very much lacking in the skill of grinding
and then started dancing...
so we just kinda chilled around for another half an hour
and we got there like a half an hour after it started but it was uber slow
then kelsey's date drove us to the dance
and it was very very quiet
and my mom...
and it was like six juniors
mainly because my mom was the first adult there
it was one of the most awkward experiences she's ever had
like my mom told me afterwards
which was suuuper awkward
for like a really quick preparty
i met at Kelsey's date's house
haha sooooo
<3
into the ebbing tide of your respect and endearment
vomit from the pit of your heart
*heart
*shards
made from shard of your hart
<3
i accept
and yes
love
just pure
then love
!!!!!
raaaawr
and spicy
but it's so like exotic and foreign
you would look good in it!
it's a hot dress!
what??
"exotic" is the perfect word
but exotic
and it's very elegant
or maybe even like a north-african woman
like i can't see anything but a really hot middle-eastern woman in it
hmm that dress
haha i feel like a lot of foreign cultures have influences on your dress choices
and his parents weren't home...
she slept over at his house..
i think they mighta had sex last night
wow shoulda seen that
ug ug haha?
the more unnattractive he seems
the more i look at him
you know i always thought that kelsey's date was like attractive
haha yes true little one
but i'm sure she would do the same to me so it's okay
cuz i cropped the shit out of her
i feel slightly bad for my date haha
hahaha <3 i love you
and like three other videos of Baby Lorises
we all watched it haha
at my afterparty
your video of the baby loris
i was gonna tell you
i saw you typing
toodles yo

haha that sounds like a lot of fun
/tell me about it
haha what'd you doo??
your winter ball was yesterday right?

but does not really strike me as totally different
that's slightly odd
hey, i'm expanding myself
haha <3 i embrace all realms of musical enrichment
and it was actually not bad
and i was like okay maybe i'll try it
and i saw some come up on my youtube thing
she mentioned it in class that she liked country music
haha country music actually
i was just talking to her...
there's not really an end to this story...
most definitely
and unbelieeeevably hot
and kind of shy
she's like really tiny
so she's high quality material
she also went to souderton...
who is just dashing by the way
i got in a conversation with this girl in my math class
it was okayish
but i forgot to a respond so she probably thinks i'm mad at her
Amanda forgave me i think

mreeeeEEeeep
nooope
brb
and WHAT IS WRONG WITH HER TODAY
so i figured i'd share...
well i figured you'd be more interested in that whole werid anon-sex thing that i am
and the hotel is filled with tons of little rooms and nooks and crannies and is always empty
so you meet like 10529150 new people
like, you're constantly always sharing ski lifts with people, sharing tables with people, sharing a corner of the lodge with someone
i feel like a ski resort is the eaaaaasiest place to have a randy hookup
okaaaaaaaaaytopic change
ahhhh :(
that's sooooo weird
ahhhhhh
stop
no you didn't
fills me with fright
like
it honestly worries me
i'm sorry for scarring you, but i have to put it out there
okay i'm just saying i find it incredibly odd that some girls can lick their own nipples
revealing my beautifully sculpted upper torso...
i was wearing like an under armour t shirt
shhh
no no that came later
stop that
i had fun
okay
it was fun
and we talked
and she sat next to me
along with their soccer team...
and then we all went out to get dinner
and talked while we waited for the other two at the bottom
so this bitch and i hit the terrain park
and so i was like SURE WHY NOT
"Hey Tyler if you wanna go on the terrain park, you can go with my friend Maddie and I'll go with Alex on the main trail"
and the girl we know, Sarah, was like
one of which we know
and then we met up with these two girls
so i would take him down all the easy trails
so i was teaching mah friend Alex how to board today
no one else cares
please?
can i tell my story though?
and literally my whole body is like severely aching
btw i had 7 matches over saturday and friday
i met a cute girl today
anyway
D:
aaaaaaaand that shit crashed and burned
so i sprang into an engaging conversation to try to convince her that i was indeed still apart of her life
she was like "Tyler why have you left my life :( "
and she texted me first!
gooooooodamnit
eh she's probably in a bad mood...
haha what did i dooooo :( ?
goddamnit
"That's really mean"
"Wait, you guys aren't public?"
"What are you implying?"
"You and Kaylie!"
"What...?"
"How's Kaylie? Did you guys decide to wait for sex or...?"
:(
haha wow she's actually pissed at me
at my homosexual implications..
wow haha she seriously took offense...
89...
86 seconds ago?
she gets confused pretty easily
...
and she got really confused
if you and her were deciding to wait for sex
i asked Panda
because it starts with j

sleep with one eye open, bitch
i don't need your permission
oh i will
i'm gonna tattoo a penis on your face
i will paint you in your sleep
speaking like what?
now*
so know i can bask in the glory of truancy
i feel fine
and after a few pills of ibuprofen
i should get sick more often
like hallelujah!
and i have an excuse to push all my work back a day!
and preeeeetty much did nothing all day
watched some netflix
slept pretty much till 3:00
i skipped school
like, i got to do all the things i'd normally feel horrible about doing
but i fucking loooooooove being sick
oh i'm sorry to hear that
and people are always like
i didn't go to school today because i was sick

wait

hehe
you little taco
okai baibai
bitch
eat my diatribe
i love you
:)
not really grammar...
or etymology
linguistics
like
i think that would be
Aghh!!
oh no!
what would they do then???
what about a 0%????
which is weird
the ACT has a science section
anyway
yes
but yes
oddly*
it's like all the western colleges that accept it
i never took that one
ugh
does everyone take the SAT at souderton?
agreed
yeah
and thaaaaaat blows aha
boom de yada motherfucker
i'll never have to take another one im my life
s
yo fuck standardized test
oh
wow
that's it?
ahh a test
they're only in PA, i'll tell you that
haha sh what are keystones
i mean perform oral sex >:)
and by eat
>;)
if you get my drift
maybe i'll let her
yess >:)
haha she could eat me
she's super muscular though
haha yeah i guess so
nooooot really
(we went to the same summer camp)
she has been texting me a few times a week haha
aka four years ago
ever since she and i met
yes haha
go take a nap <3
it shouldn't have been either of you
like you wanted to be with him?
i know silly but i don't think you should feel like...
*to
you've made my life sooo much better i can't imagine what i'd do if i didn't have anyone to bitch too
what would I do? what would Amanda do?
you really don't
you don't want that Kaylie
you can't think like... what if?
what if you had both died? you can't pretend like just bad things can be changed
guilt sucks :(
but honestly, just hang in there boo because i know you're on the uphill
it'd be time to worry
eh
if you weren't on that process,
that's all part of this vast recuperation process
Crying and stuff, dreaming about him, etc.
well it's good to get it out Kaylie!
i can't even imagine how much more fucked up i'd be
i've never felt the sort of love i'm assuming you two shared, but if i did, and it was taken from me so abruptly
and honestly, for something soooo incredibly traumatic to happen to someone, i think you really recovered well
but don't put yourself down like that, i mean you can't really think about what could have been
well neither of you deserved to die
you're really not Kaylie
no one would expect you to recover from something like that so quickly
well not much time has passed
well do you think it's at all true?
and that's the only reason they're saying it to you
and they know that YOU know that it's not true
and they know it's not true
well, it's true that i don't, but everyone knows that it's just ridiculous that they'd say that because you're so obviously not a disappointment to anyone
heyy i still love you <3 and your mom just seems to be kind of back and forth a bit
aw well i know you care
so it's okay that you're having all these matriarchal conflicts
i'm sorry :/ but i mean this is like one of the most difficult times in a person's life
that's good...
how'd it go...?
oh good luck boo <3
which is your favorite
E - engage physically
where he goes in and pretends to be filling a prescription for his edlerly grandmother
D - demonstrate value
he has what's called the DENNIS system
yesssie haha
pobrecita
:(
and the girl he decides to play is a girl named Kaylie who works in a pharmacy
demonstrating how easy it is for him to play girls
is about this guy Dennis
and one episode
so i was watching It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia
that is weird
yes
idk if there's an exact definition
Haha sorry I was playing piano
do it
psh
o i like it
yay what song?
awww
of course not :)
nooooo i wasn't gonna say anything that's cool!
that's cool
yo
awww
ooo good luck hon!
herm
really?
hello fiend
oh hush
<3 but he's mine
they're perfect
no they're not
https://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/545283_10100584086777217_1318528139_n.jpg
and your boy Matt Miller haha
i know sophie was
there were soooo many people
haha i actually don't know
"Now that's some fuckin' GA wrestling for you right there"
and was like
my old coach came up to me after
poor kid
right??
look at dat picture
https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151348852052937&set=t.1722475997&type=3&theater
haha score yooo.
thank youu
and has like a legit paragraph on me
like the most important
and the other article talked about how my match was probably the biggest
he like said how huge it was that i managed to come up from JV and get a major decision
thanks <3 they interviewed my coach and he talked about me
-.-
yes
and they chanted my name haha
and so like after I won and shit, every single person on our team came up and hugged me in like this giant pile
and then our team came back and ended up winning by decision with the final score being 32-32
and not only won, but gained our team an extra point for a win by major decision
but i went out and kicked the kid's freaking ass
and like, nobody really expected me to win
same with all my teachers, former coaches
and eeeeevery one of my friends is watching me
and like this entire stadium full of people is just watching me as i go out onto the mat
and if I lose, it becomes impossible for our team to win
by the time it's my match, it's 22-32 and our team is down
so ANYWAY
and in the even of a tie, whichever team has more wins is the winning team
and it could swing either way
and the coaches worked out every point in the match, and it was expected to come down to a 1 point difference
so our coach had our 132 lb. wrestler go up to 138 lb, so i ended up coming up to wrestle at 132 lb
but the other team changed their varsity lineup
and i wasn't supposed to wrestle in it since i'm a JV wrestler usually
reporters came, etc.
and like half our entire school came out
big big match
so like, huge match
atleast in the last 5 years
so the GA vs Malvern match is like the most anticipated match in the league
well okay
hmph
hola
hi
shhh
nope
-.-
i should do hw anyway
i'll tell it some other time
leave
eh fine
omg...
and this year was predicted to be the year we finally lose it to another school, Malvern
and like 20 years before that
we've dominated the last seven years
and basically
is in a wrestling league called the inter-acs
so our school GA
OKAY FINE
i'm in two newspapers haha

like it's very cocktail-dressy to me
something weird about the boob region
not wild about it
eh

that would feel super weird for me

shooobaddabeddeeeedabadaba
<3
oh i will ;)
naked
with lots of soap
briskly
everywhere
and scrub myself
okay i have to go shower
<3 luv yoo
he's weird boo
when he could be out fucking girls left and right and getting wasted off his ass all the time
and like Jacobs
hangs out with ME
that he's clearly more attractive than
he goes out with a girl
but idk
okay you get a pass
like i have never met a girl that wasn't like super infatuated with him
yeah they do dude
hang out with whomever he wanted,
so he could go out with any girl he wanted
he's super attractive, super fucking smart, super good at piano, and super social
honestly
i mean he comes across that way sometimes
aw he's a good guy
like he's never told me about a time he got at all intoxicated
i don't even know if Jason drinks
you know
*huge
it sounds awesome to me
and he said he didn't want to be a part of it haha
saturated with alcohol and drugs and sex
some hug party house thing
he said there was like
and have like a weeklong roadtrip
the closer one
world?
land?
to let him drive me to disneyworld
he was gonna try to convince his parents
Jason said for Senior week
also
ooo
sketchy
who is taking pictures on his iphone?
Jason says he's the "photographer"
honestly i think my boss is too
and i think the little kids are scared of him
and he always brings him to the piano studio
haha i know
*hurts
like it hirts
like suuuuuper weird
damn that kid is so weird
haha do you know Jason's friend Jacob Ford?
haha you funny little peppernut
haha por que?
oh yeah haha don't they work at Hollister?
is super familiar though
that name
and i don't think sooo
FUCK HIM HEZ A DJ
:D
so how are you
okay
Paul was
hmm she was there
oo and do you know Ashley Domzalski?
but when she showed up at the party i was like who is that hot-ass girl over there??
i'm like wow she's not very pretty
like, stalking her on fb,
haha i agree
hmm do you find her attractive?
i did i did
ahh yes
did i tell you about the prank call?
i feel like she's gonna rape me though
she is!
ahhhhhghhhh
Livvy's D...
ahhhhh
oh god!?!?
haha dude she just spontaneously kissed me on the cheek too
haha Livvy tried to get reallllll personal with me at said brawl
and so anyway
oh i will
and it devolved into everyone tackling each other
Jason calls it the yearly wrestling tournament
every year there's like this big brawl thing
haha at Jason's party
*downside
that's the downsize
haha it's usually interrupted by violence though haha
haha oh boy does that sound gay as shiiiiiiiit
so we all get in a giant pile and just cuddle
and there's nowhere to sleep
like at tournaments, they'll have big matts open
sometimes we have team cuddles
haha idk you just do
and i'm never gay about it -.-
but it's never one specific wrestler
and i'm very touchy too
i cuddle with particular wrestlers all the time
like, don't get me wrong
he's also very touchy
haha that's a pretty good idea
...he may have misinterpreted my amnesty
so i'm always nice to him
the whole team abuses him
haha
i feel bad though
he's definitely gay
now that i say it out loud
like
it was preeeeeetty gay
and he kept spraying soap on me
and i was like, alright, we'll get showers all to ourselves
let's shower in the swimmer's locker room
like one time he was like
but i like never see him express any interest in her
but she's like always all over him
he has a gf
ALWAYS WANTS ME TO SHOWER WITH HIM
always wants to be my partner, always wants to team up with me haha
trying to snuggle me
he is ALWAYS
first of all
yeah
i think one of the wrestlers has a crush on me
meh it was rough
they blow massive balls
they suck
i hate tuna cans now
i sorted tuna cans at philabundance for four hours :(
i did community service most of it
it was alright haha

and a terrible influence
he's a jackass

haha nooooo
sooo kinda a double edged sword
well he was also smoking a cigar while telling me this
he says i should be fucking bitches left and right regardless of their social status
my brother made the same argument you're making
if it makes you feel better

atleast anymore haha
she's not really mean to me
good point
haha well who else would i ask
